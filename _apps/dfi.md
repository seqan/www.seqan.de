Sequential pattern mining, also known as frequency based string mining, has been the objective of various algorithmic
approaches over the last years. A recent breakthrough, the linear time algorithm by Fischer, Heun, and Kramer (FHK), has
turned out to be theoretically optimal and also quite fast in practice. In 2008, we presented a conceptually much 
simpler algorithm based on a deferred data structure that is faster and uses less memory at the same time. In this 
paper, we give an in-depth presentation of this algorithm and show how to use it on multiple databases with a variety 
of frequency constraints. As such, we use the notion of entropy from information theory to devise the Entropy Substring 
Mining Problem which is a multiple database generalization of the Emerging Substring Mining Problem. In addition, we 
evaluate the algorithm rigorously using various string domains, e.g., natural language, DNA, or protein sequences. The
experiments demonstrate the improvement of our algorithm compared to recent approaches.
