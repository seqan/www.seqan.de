We present a read simulator software for Illumina, 454 and Sanger reads. Its features include position specific error
rates and base quality values. For Illumina reads, we give a comprehensive analysis with empirical data for the error
and quality model. For the other technologies, we use models from the literature. It has been written with performance
in mind and can sample reads from large genomes. The C++ source code is extensible, and freely available under the
GPL/LGPL.
