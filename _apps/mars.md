Mars is a tool that reads a structural multiple RNA alignment (e.g. from [LaRa 2](https://www.seqan.de/apps/lara.html))
and derives fuzzy stem loop descriptors from it. These descriptors are then subject to a search in a genomic database
and Mars returns the hits where the RNA structure is found, accompanied with a quality value for each hit.
