- abstract: "Peptide sequencing from mass spectrometry data is a key step in proteome\
    \ research. Especially de novo sequencing, the identification of a peptide from\
    \ its spectrum alone, is still a challenge even for state-of-the-art algorithmic\
    \ approaches. In this paper we present ANTILOPE, a new fast and flexible approach\
    \ based on mathematical programming. It builds on the spectrum graph model and\
    \ works with a variety of scoring schemes. ANTILOPE combines Lagrangian relaxation\
    \ for solving an integer linear programming formulation with an adaptation of\
    \ Yen\u2019s k shortest paths algorithm. It shows a significant improvement in\
    \ running time compared to mixed integer optimization and performs at the same\
    \ speed like other state-of-the-art tools. We also implemented a generic probabilistic\
    \ scoring scheme that can be trained automatically for a dataset of annotated\
    \ spectra and is independent of the mass spectrometer type. Evaluations on benchmark\
    \ data show that ANTILOPE is competitive to the popular state-of-the-art programs\
    \ PepNovo and NovoHMM both in terms of run time and accuracy. Furthermore, it\
    \ offers increased flexibility in the number of considered ion types. ANTILOPE\
    \ will be freely available as part of the open source proteomics library OpenMS."

- abstract: Mass spectrometry coupled to liquid chromatography (LC-MS and LC-MS/MS)
    is commonly used to analyze the protein content of biological samples in large
    scale studies, enabling quantitation and identification of proteins and peptides
    using a wide range of experimental protocols, algorithms, and statistical models
    to analyze the data. Currently it is difficult to compare the plethora of algorithms
    for these tasks. So far, curated benchmark data exists for peptide identification
    algorithms but data that represents a ground truth for the evaluation of LC-MS
    data is limited. Hence there have been attempts to simulate such data in a controlled
    fashion to evaluate and compare algorithms. We present MSSimulator, a simulation
    software for LC-MS and LC-MS/MS experiments. Starting from a list of proteins
    from a FASTA file,the simulation will perform in-silico digestion, retention time
    prediction,  ionization filtering, and raw signal simulation (including MS/MS),
    while providing many options to change the properties of the resultingdata like
    elution profile shape, resolution and sampling rate. Several protocols for SILAC,
    iTRAQ or MS(E) are available, in addition to the usual label-free approach, making
    MSSimulator the most comprehensive simulator for LC-MS and LC-MS/MS data.

- abstract: Mass spectrometry is today a key analytical technique to elucidate the
    amount and content of proteins expressed in a certain cellular context. The degree
    of automation in proteomics has yet to reach that of genomic techniques, but even
    current technologies make a manual inspection of the data infeasible. This article
    addresses the key algorithmic problems bioinformaticians face when handling modern
    proteomic samples and shows common solutions to them. We provide examples on how
    algorithms can be combined to build relatively complex analysis pipelines, point
    out certain pitfalls and aspects worth considering and give a list of current
    state-of-the-art tools.

    \ pairs. Sequencing reads crossing boundaries of structural variation carry the\
    \ potential for their identification, but are difficult to map.\r\n\r\nResults:\
    \ Here we present a method for \u2018split\u2019 read mapping, where prefix and\
    \ suffix match of a read may be interrupted by a longer gap in the read-to-reference\
    \ alignment. We use this method to accurately detect medium-sized insertions and\
    \ long deletions with precise breakpoints in genomic resequencing data. Compared\
    \ with alternative split mapping methods, SplazerS significantly improves sensitivity\
    \ for detecting large indel events, especially in variant-rich regions. Our method\
    \ is robust in the presence of sequencing errors as well as alignment errors due\
    \ to genomic mutations/divergence, and can be used on reads of variable lengths.\
    \ Our analysis shows that SplazerS is a versatile tool applicable to unanchored\
    \ or single-end as well as anchored paired-end reads. In addition, application\

    search and join. Our methods are variations of those applied in Masai [15], our
    recently published tool for mapping high-throughput DNA sequencing data with unpreceded

    backtracking amortizes the cost of searching a large set of seeds. Combined together,

    \ developments promise the personal $1,000 genome in a couple of years. The analysis\
    \ of these unprecedented amounts of data demands for efficient data structures\
    \ and algorithms. One such data structures is the substring index, that represents\
    \ all substrings or substrings up to a certain length contained in a given text.\r\
    \nIn this thesis we propose 3 substring indices, which we extend to be applicable\
    \ to millions of sequences. We devise internal and external memory construction\
    \ algorithms and a uniform framework for accessing the generalized suffix tree.\
    \ Additionally we propose different index-based applications, e.g. exact and approximate\
    \ pattern matching and different repeat search algorithms.\r\nSecond, we present\
    \ the read mapping tool RazerS, which aligns millions of single or paired-end\
    \ reads of arbitrary lengths to their potential genomic origin using either Hamming\
    \ or edit distance. Our tool can work either lossless or with a user-defined loss\
    \ rate at higher speeds. Given the loss rate, we present a novel approach that\
    \ guarantees not to lose more reads than specified. This enables the user to adapt\
    \ to the problem at hand and provides a seamless tradeoff between sensitivity\
    \ and running time. We compare RazerS with other state-of-the-art read mappers\
    \ and show that it has the highest sensitivity and a comparable performance on\
    \ various real-world datasets.\r\nAt last, we propose a general approach for frequency\
    \ based string mining, which has many applications, e.g. in contrast data mining.\
    \ Our contribution is a novel and lightweight algorithm that is faster and uses\
    \ less memory than the best available algorithms. We show its applicability for\
    \ mining multiple databases with a variety of frequency constraints. As such,\
    \ we use the notion of entropy from information theory to generalize the emerging\

- abstract: We evaluated 25 protocol variants of 14 independent computational methods
    for exon identification, transcript reconstruction and expression-level quantification
    from RNA-seq data. Our results show that most algorithms are able to identify
    discrete transcript components with high success rates but that assembly of complete
    isoform structures poses a major challenge even when all constituent elements
    are identified. Expression-level estimates also varied widely across methods,
    even when based on similar transcript models. Consequently, the complexity of
    higher eukaryotic genomes imposes severe limitations on transcript recall and
    splice product discrimination that are likely to remain limiting factors for the
    analysis of current-generation RNA-seq data.

- abstract: Mass spectrometry coupled to high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC-MS)
    is evolving more quickly than ever. A wide range of different instrument types
    and experimental setups are commonly used. Modern instruments acquire huge amounts
    of data, thus requiring tools for an efficient and automated data analysis. Most
    existing software for analyzing HPLC-MS data is monolithic and tailored toward
    a specific application. A more flexible alternative consists of pipeline-based
    tool kits allowing the construction of custom analysis workflows from small building
    blocks, e.g., the Trans Proteomics Pipeline (TPP) or The OpenMS Proteomics Pipeline
    (TOPP). One drawback, however, is the hurdle of setting up complex workflows using
    command line tools. We present TOPPAS, The OpenMS Proteomics Pipeline ASsistant,
    a graphical user interface (GUI) for rapid composition of HPLC-MS analysis workflows.
    Workflow construction reduces to simple drag-and-drop of analysis tools and adding
    connections in between. Integration of external tools into these workflows is
    possible as well. Once workflows have been developed, they can be deployed in
    other workflow management systems or batch processing systems in a fully automated
    fashion. The implementation is portable and has been tested under Windows, Mac
    OS X, and Linux. TOPPAS is open-source software and available free of charge at
    http://www.OpenMS.de/TOPPAS .

- abstract: Rapid and efficient quality control according to the public authority
    regulations is mandatory to guarantee safety of the pharmaceuticals and to save
    resources in the pharmaceutical industry. In the case of so-called "grandfather
    products" like the synthetic thyroid hormone thyroxine, strict regulations enforce
    a detailed chemical analysis in order to characterize potentially toxic or pharmacologically
    relevant impurities. We report a straightforward workflow for the comprehensive
    impurity profiling of synthetic thyroid hormones and impurities employing ultrahigh-performance
    liquid chromatography (UHPLC) hyphenated to high-resolution mass spectrometry
    (HRMS). Five different batches of synthetic thyroxin were analyzed resulting in
    the detection of 71 impurities within 3 min total analysis time. Structural elucidation
    of the compounds was accomplished via a combination of accurate mass measurements,
    computer based calculations of molecular formulas, multistage high-resolution
    mass spectrometry (HRMS(n)), and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, which
    enabled the identification of 71 impurities, of which 47 have been unknown so
    far. Thirty of the latter were structurally elucidated, including products of
    deiodination, aliphatic chain oxidation, as well as dimeric compounds as new class
    of thyroid hormone derivatives. Limits of detection for the thyroid compounds
    were in the 6 ng/mL range for negative electrospray ionization mass spectrometric
    detection in full scan mode. Within day and day-to-day repeatabilities of retention
    times and peak areas were below 0.5% and 3.5% R.SD. The performance characteristics
    of the method in terms of robustness and information content clearly show that
    UHPLC-HRMS is adequate for the rapid and reliable detection, identification, and
    semiquantitative determination of trace levels of impurities in synthetic pharmaceuticals.

- abstract: A reaction scheme was derived for the thermal degradation of thyroxine
    in the solid state, using data obtained from ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography
    and high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS). To study the reaction mechanism
    and kinetics of the thermal degradation of the pharmaceutical in the solid state,
    a workflow was developed by generating compound-specific, time-dependent degradation
    or formation curves of at least 13 different degradation products. Such curves
    allowed one to distinguish between first- and second-generation degradation products,
    as well as impurities resulting from chemical synthesis. The structures of the
    degradation products were derived from accurate molecular masses and multistage
    mass spectrometry. Deiodination and oxidative side chain degradation were found
    to be the major degradation reactions, resulting in the formation of deiodinated
    thyroxines, as well as acetic acid, benzoic acid, formaldehyde, acetamide, hydroxyacetic
    acid, oxoacetic acid, hydroxyacetamide, or oxoacetamide derivatives of thyroxine
    or deiodinated thyroxine. Upon additional structural verification of mass spectrometric
    data using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, this comprehensive body of
    data sheds light on an elaborate, radical-driven reaction scheme, explaining the
    presence or formation of impurities in thermally stressed thyroxine.

    \n\r\nResults\r\nWe present two algorithms for inclusion list creation that formulate\

    \ data can have a dramatic impact on the amount of usable base pairs and their\
    \ quality. It has been shown that the performance of tasks such as de novo genome\
    \ assembly and SNP calling can be dramatically improved after read error correction.\
    \ While a large number of methods specialized for correcting substitution errors\
    \ as found in Illumina data exist, few methods for the correction of indel errors,\
    \ common to technologies like 454 or Ion Torrent, have been proposed.Results:\
    \ We present Fiona, a new stand-alone read error\xE2\uFFFD\uFFFDcorrection method.\
    \ Fiona provides a new statistical approach for sequencing error detection and\
    \ optimal error correction and estimates its parameters automatically. Fiona is\
    \ able to correct substitution, insertion and deletion errors and can be applied\
    \ to any sequencing technology. It uses an efficient implementation of the partial\
    \ suffix array to detect read overlaps with different seed lengths in parallel.\

    \ correction of high-throughput sequencing data can have a dramatic impact on\
    \ the amount of usable base pairs and their quality. It has been shown that the\

    \ specialized for correcting substitution errors as found in Illumina data exist,\

    \ ancestral module through a series of evolutionary events. A meta-heuristic method\
    \ simulated annealing was used to search for the optimal or near-optimal inner\
    \ nodes (i.e. ancestral modules) of the evolutionary tree. To evaluate the performance\
    \ and the statistical significance, LocalAli were tested on a total of 26 real\
    \ datasets and 1040 randomly generated datasets. The results suggest that LocalAli\
    \ outperforms all existing algorithms in terms of coverage, consistency and scalability,\
    \ meanwhile retains a high precision in the identification of functionally coherent\
    \ subnetworks.\n\nAVAILABILITY:The source code and test datasets are freely available\

- abstract: The increasing scale and complexity of quantitative proteomics studies
    complicate subsequent analysis of the acquired data. Untargeted label-free quantification,
    based either on feature intensities or on spectral counting, is a method that
    scales particularly well with respect to the number of samples. It is thus an
    excellent alternative to labeling techniques. In order to profit from this scalability,
    however, data analysis has to cope with large amounts of data, process them automatically,
    and do a thorough statistical analysis in order to achieve reliable results. We
    review the state of the art with respect to computational tools for label-free
    quantification in untargeted proteomics. The two fundamental approaches are feature-based
    quantification, relying on the summed-up mass spectrometric intensity of peptides,
    and spectral counting, which relies on the number of MS/MS spectra acquired for
    a certain protein. We review the current algorithmic approaches underlying some
    widely used software packages and briefly discuss the statistical strategies for
    analyzing the data.

- abstract: 'In mass spectrometry-based shotgun proteomics, protein identifications
    are usually the desired result. However, most of the analytical methods are based
    on the identification of reliable peptides and not the direct identification of
    intact proteins. Thus, assembling peptides identified from tandem mass spectra
    into a list of proteins, referred to as protein inference, is a critical step
    in proteomics research. Currently, different protein inference algorithms and
    tools are available for the proteomics community. Here, we evaluated five software
    tools for protein inference (PIA, ProteinProphet, Fido, ProteinLP, MSBayesPro)
    using three popular database search engines: Mascot, X!Tandem, and MS-GF +. All
    the algorithms were evaluated using a highly customizable KNIME workflow using
    four different public datasets with varying complexities (different sample preparation,
    species and analytical instruments). We defined a set of quality control metrics
    to evaluate the performance of each combination of search engines, protein inference
    algorithm, and parameters on each dataset. We show that the results for complex
    samples vary not only regarding the actual numbers of reported protein groups
    but also concerning the actual composition of groups. Furthermore, the robustness
    of reported proteins when using databases of differing complexities is strongly
    dependant on the applied inference algorithm. Finally, merging the identifications
    of multiple search engines does not necessarily increase the number of reported
    proteins, but does increase the number of peptides per protein and thus can generally

    \ labelled as being gluten free. Why is the content of such gluten proteins of\
    \ importance for the fabrication of bakery industry and for the products? The\
    \ gluten proteins represent up to 80 % of wheat proteins, and they are conventionally\
    \ subdivided into gliadins and glutenins. Gliadins belong to the proline and glutamine-rich\
    \ prolamin family. Its role in human gluten intolerance, as a consequence of its\
    \ harmful effects, is well documented in the scientific literature. The only known\
    \ therapy so far is a gluten-free diet, and hence, it is important to develop\
    \ robust and reliable analytical methods to quantitatively assess the presence\
    \ of the identified peptides causing the so-called coeliac disease. This work\
    \ describes the development of a new, fast and robust micro ion pair-LC-MS analytical\
    \ method for the qualitative and quantitative determination of 30-mer toxic gliadin\
    \ peptides in wheat flour. The use of RapiGest\u2122 SF as a denaturation reagent\
    \ prior to the enzymatic digestion showed to shorten the measuring time. During\
    \ the optimisation of the enzymatic digestion step, the best 30-mer toxic peptide\
    \ was identified from the maximum recovery after 3 h of digestion time. The lower\
    \ limit of quantification was determined to be 0.25 ng/\u03BCL. The method has\
    \ shown to be linear for the selected concentration range of 0.25\u20133.0 ng/\u03BC\
    L. The uncertainty related to reproducibility of measurement procedure, excluding\
    \ the extraction step, has shown to be 5.0 % (N\u2009=\u200912). Finally, this\
    \ method was successfully applied to the quantification of 30-mer toxic peptides\
    \ from commercial wheat flour with an overall uncertainty under reproducibility\
    \ conditions of 6.4 % including the extraction of the gliadin fraction. The results\
    \ were always expressed as the average of the values from all standard concentrations.\
    \ Subsequently, the final concentration of the 30-mer toxic peptide in the flour\
    \ was calculated and expressed in milligrams per gram unit. The determined, calculated\

- abstract: Many disciplines, from human genetics and oncology to plant breeding,
    microbiology and virology, commonly face the challenge of analyzing rapidly increasing
    numbers of genomes. In case of Homo sapiens, the number of sequenced genomes will
    approach hundreds of thousands in the next few years. Simply scaling up established
    bioinformatics pipelines will not be sufficient for leveraging the full potential
    of such rich genomic data sets. Instead, novel, qualitatively different computational
    methods and paradigms are needed. We will witness the rapid extension of computational
    pan-genomics, a new sub-area of research in computational biology. In this article,
    we generalize existing definitions and understand a pan-genome as any collection
    of genomic sequences to be analyzed jointly or to be used as a reference. We examine
    already available approaches to construct and use pan-genomes, discuss the potential
    benefits of future technologies and methodologies and review open challenges from
    the vantage point of the above-mentioned biological disciplines. As a prominent
    example for a computational paradigm shift, we particularly highlight the transition
    from the representation of reference genomes as strings to representations as
    graphs. We outline how this and other challenges from different application domains
    translate into common computational problems, point out relevant bioinformatics
    techniques and identify open problems in computer science. With this review, we
    aim to increase awareness that a joint approach to computational pan-genomics
    can help address many of the problems currently faced in various domains.

    \ algorithm that analyzes the patterns of variant calls in the 178 structurally\
    \ variable regions of the GRCh38 genome assembly, and infers whether a given sample\
    \ is most likely to contain sequences from the primary assembly, an alternate\
    \ locus, or their heterozygous combination at each of these 178 regions. We investigate\
    \ 121 in-house WGS datasets that have been aligned to the GRCh37 and GRCh38 assemblies.\r\

- abstract: "The unidirectional FM index was introduced by Ferragina and Manzini in\
    \ 2000 and allows to search a pattern in the index in one direction. The bidirectional\
    \ FM index (2FM) was introduced by Lam et al. in 2009. It allows to search for\
    \ a pattern by extending an infix of the pattern arbitrarily to the left or right.\
    \ If \u03C3 is the size of the alphabet then the method of Lam et al. can conduct\
    \ one step in time O(\u03C3) while needing space O(\u03C3\u22C5n) using constant\
    \ time rank queries on bit vectors. Schnattinger and colleagues improved this\
    \ time to O(log\u03C3) while using O(log\u03C3\u22C5n) bits of space for both,\

- abstract: Identification and quantification of microorganisms is a significant step
    in studying the alpha and beta diversities within and between microbial communities
    respectively. Both identification and quantification of a given microbial community
    can be carried out using whole genome shotgun sequences with less bias than when
    using 16S-rDNA sequences. However, shared regions of DNA among reference genomes
    and taxonomic units pose a significant challenge in assigning reads correctly
    to their true origins. The existing microbial community profiling tools commonly
    deal with this problem by either preparing signature-based unique references or
    assigning an ambiguous read to its least common ancestor in a taxonomic tree.
    The former method is limited to making use of the reads which can be mapped to
    the curated regions, while the latter suffer from the lack of uniquely mapped
    reads at lower (more specific) taxonomic ranks. Moreover, even if the tools exhibited
    good performance in calling the organisms present in a sample, there is still
    room for improvement in determining the correct relative abundance of the organisms.
    We present a new method Species Level Identification of Microorganisms from Metagenomes
    (SLIMM) which addresses the above issues by using coverage information of reference
    genomes to remove unlikely genomes from the analysis and subsequently gain more
    uniquely mapped reads to assign at lower ranks of a taxonomic tree. SLIMM is based
    on a few, seemingly easy steps which when combined create a tool that outperforms
    state-of-the-art tools in run-time and memory usage while being on par or better
    in computing quantitative and qualitative information at species-level.

- abstract: High-resolution mass spectrometry (MS) has become an important tool in
    the life sciences, contributing to the diagnosis and understanding of human diseases,
    elucidating biomolecular structural information and characterizing cellular signaling
    networks. However, the rapid growth in the volume and complexity of MS data makes
    transparent, accurate and reproducible analysis difficult. We present OpenMS 2.0

- abstract: "Motivation\r\n\r\nPairwise sequence alignment is undoubtedly a central\
    \ tool in many bioinformatics analyses. In this paper, we present a generically\
    \ accelerated module for pairwise sequence lignments applicable for a broad range\
    \ of applications. In our module, we unified the standard dynamic programming\
    \ kernel used for pairwise sequence alignments and extended it with a generalized\
    \ inter-sequence vectorization layout, such that many alignments can be computed\
    \ simultaneously by exploiting SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data) instructions\
    \ of modern processors. We then extended the module by adding two layers of thread-level\
    \ parallelization, where we a) distribute many independent alignments on multiple\
    \ threads and b) inherently parallelize a single alignment computation using a\
    \ work stealing approach producing a dynamic wavefront progressing along the minor\
    \ diagonal.\r\n\r\nResults\r\n\r\nWe evaluated our alignment vectorization and\
    \ parallelization on different processors, including the newest Intel\xAE Xeon\xAE\
    \ (Skylake) and Intel\xAE Xeon Phi\u2122 (KNL) processors, and use cases. The\
    \ instruction set AVX512-BW (Byte and Word), available on Skylake processors,\
    \ can genuinely improve the performance of vectorized alignments. We could run\

  bibtex: "@article{fu_mi_publications2253,\n abstract = {Motivation\n\nPairwise sequence\
    \ alignment is undoubtedly a central tool in many bioinformatics analyses. In\
    \ this paper, we present a generically accelerated module for pairwise sequence\
    \ lignments applicable for a broad range of applications. In our module, we unified\
    \ the standard dynamic programming kernel used for pairwise sequence alignments\
    \ and extended it with a generalized inter-sequence vectorization layout, such\
    \ that many alignments can be computed simultaneously by exploiting SIMD (Single\
    \ Instruction Multiple Data) instructions of modern processors. We then extended\
    \ the module by adding two layers of thread-level parallelization, where we a)\
    \ distribute many independent alignments on multiple threads and b) inherently\
    \ parallelize a single alignment computation using a work stealing approach producing\
    \ a dynamic wavefront progressing along the minor diagonal.\n\nResults\n\nWe evaluated\
    \ our alignment vectorization and parallelization on different processors, including\
    \ the newest Intel? Xeon? (Skylake) and Intel? Xeon Phi? (KNL) processors, and\
    \ use cases. The instruction set AVX512-BW (Byte and Word), available on Skylake\
    \ processors, can genuinely improve the performance of vectorized alignments.\
    \ We could run single alignments 1600 times faster on the Xeon Phi? and 1400 times\
    \ faster on the Xeon? than executing them with our previous sequential alignment\
    \ module.\n\nAvailability\n\nThe module is programmed in C++ using the SeqAn (Reinert\

- abstract: Finding approximate occurrences of a pattern in a text using a full-text
    index is a central problem in bioinformatics and has been extensively researched.
    Bidirectional indices have opened new possibilities in this regard allowing the
    search to start from anywhere within the pattern and extend in both directions.
    In particular, use of search schemes (partitioning the pattern and searching the
    pieces in certain orders with given bounds on errors) can yield significant speed-ups.
    However, finding optimal search schemes is a difficult combinatorial optimization
    problem. Here for the first time, we propose a mixed integer program (MIP) capable
    to solve this optimization problem for Hamming distance with given number of pieces.
    Our experiments show that the optimal search schemes found by our MIP significantly
    improve the performance of search in bidirectional FM-index upon previous ad-hoc
    solutions. For example, approximate matching of 101-bp Illumina reads (with two
    errors) becomes 35 times faster than standard backtracking. Moreover, despite
    being performed purely in the index, the running time of search using our optimal
    schemes (for up to two errors) is comparable to the best state-of-the-art aligners,
    which benefit from combining search in index with in-text verification using dynamic
    programming. As a result, we anticipate a full-fledged aligner that employs an
    intelligent combination of search in the bidirectional FM-index using our optimal
    search schemes and in-text verification using dynamic programming outperforms
    today's best aligners. The development of such an aligner, called FAMOUS (Fast
    Approximate string Matching using OptimUm search Schemes), is ongoing as our future
    work.

- abstract: Accurate protein inference in the presence of shared peptides is still
    one of the key problems in bottom-up proteomics. Most protein inference tools
    employing simple heuristic inference strategies are efficient but exhibit reduced
    accuracy. More advanced probabilistic methods often exhibit better inference quality
    but tend to be too slow for large data sets. Here, we present a novel protein
    inference method, EPIFANY, combining a loopy belief propagation algorithm with
    convolution trees for efficient processing of Bayesian networks. We demonstrate
    that EPIFANY combines the reliable protein inference of Bayesian methods with
    significantly shorter runtimes. On the 2016 iPRG protein inference benchmark data,
    EPIFANY is the only tested method that finds all true-positive proteins at a 5%
    protein false discovery rate (FDR) without strict prefiltering on the peptide-spectrum
    match (PSM) level, yielding an increase in identification performance (+10% in
    the number of true positives and +14% in partial AUC) compared to previous approaches.
    Even very large data sets with hundreds of thousands of spectra (which are intractable
    with other Bayesian and some non-Bayesian tools) can be processed with EPIFANY
    within minutes. The increased inference quality including shared peptides results
    in better protein inference results and thus increased robustness of the biological
    hypotheses generated. EPIFANY is available as open-source software for all major
    platforms at https://OpenMS.de/epifany.

    \ n, the expected OBDD size of a random Boolean function\r\n\twith n variables\
    \ is equal to the worst-case size up to terms of lower\r\n\torder. Such a phenomenon\
    \ is generally called strong Shannon effect.\r\n\tHere we show that the strong\
    \ Shannon effect is not valid for all\r\n\tn. Instead it undergoes a certain periodic\
    \ `phase transition': If\r\n\tn lies within intervals of constant width around\
    \ the values n = 2h\r\n\t+ h, then the strong Shannon effect does not hold, whereas\
    \ it does\r\n\thold outside these intervals. Our analysis provides doubly exponential\r\

- abstract: The high degree of similarity between the mouse and human genomes is demonstrated
    through analysis of the sequence of mouse chromosome 16 (Mmu 16), which was obtained
    as part of a whole-genome shotgun assembly of the mouse genome. The mouse genome
    is about 10% smaller than the human genome, owing to a lower repetitive DNA content.
    Comparison of the structure and protein-coding potential of Mmu 16 with that of
    the homologous segments of the human genome identifies regions of conserved synteny
    with human chromosomes (Hsa) 3, 8, 12, 16, 21, and 22. Gene content and order
    are highly conserved between Mmu 16 and the syntenic blocks of the human genome.
    Of the 731 predicted genes on Mmu 16, 509 align with orthologs on the corre- sponding
    portions of the human genome, 44 are likely paralogous to these genes, and 164
    genes have homologs elsewhere in the human genome; there are 14 genes for which
    we could find no human counterpart.

    challenges in handling massive amounts of short- read, high-coverage data. A robust
    and versatile consensus tool is of particular interest for such data since a sound
    multi-read alignment is a prerequisite for variation analyses, accurate genome
    assemblies and insert sequencing. Results: A multi-read alignment algorithm for
    de novo or reference- guided genome assembly is presented. The program identifies
    segments shared by multiple reads and then aligns these segments using a consistency-enhanced
    alignment graph. On real de novo sequencing data obtained from the newly established
    NCBI Short Read Archive, the program performs similarly in quality to other comparable
    programs. On more challenging simulated datasets for insert sequencing and variation
    analyses, our program outperforms the other tools. Availability: The consensus
    program can be downloaded from http://www.seqan.de/projects/consensus.html. It
    can be used stand- alone or in conjunction with the Celera Assembler. Both application
    scenarios as well as the usage of the tool are described in the documentation.

    that extend the well-known Markov chains. They have been applied\r\n\tto a variety\
    \ of problems in computational biology, e.g. protein family\r\n\tclassification.\
    \ A linear time and space construction algorithm has\r\n\tbeen published in 2000\

    is commonly used to analyze the protein content of biological samples\r\n\tin\

    \ in Bioinformatics, especially in the fields of algorithm\r\n\tdevelopment, statistics\
    \ and software engineering. In a quantitative\r\n\tlabel-free mass spectrometry\
    \ experiment, crucial steps are the detection\r\n\tof peptide features in the\

    \ RESULTS:\r\n\tWe present LC-MSsim, a simulation software for LC-ESI-MS experiments.\r\

- abstract: BACKGROUND:The use of novel algorithmic techniques is pivotal to many
    important problems in life science. For example the sequencing of the human genome
    [1] would not have been possible without advanced assembly algorithms. However,
    owing to the high speed of technological progress and the urgent need for bioinformatics
    tools, there is a widening gap between state-of-the-art algorithmic techniques
    and the actual algorithmic components of tools that are in widespread use.RESULTS:To
    remedy this trend we propose the use of SeqAn, a library of efficient data types
    and algorithms for sequence analysis in computational biology. SeqAn comprises
    implementations of existing, practical state-of-the-art algorithmic components
    to provide a sound basis for algorithm testing and development. In this paper
    we describe the design and content of SeqAn and demonstrate its use by giving
    two examples. In the first example we show an application of SeqAn as an experimental
    platform by comparing different exact string matching algorithms. The second example
    is a simple version of the well-known MUMmer tool rewritten in SeqAn. Results
    indicate that our implementation is very efficient and versatile to use.CONCLUSION:We
    anticipate that SeqAn greatly simplifies the rapid development of new bioinformatics
    tools by providing a collection of readily usable, well-designed algorithmic components
    which are fundamental for the field of sequence analysis. This leverages not only
    the implementation of new algorithms, but also enables a sound analysis and comparison
    of existing algorithms.

- abstract: Currently, the precursor ion selection strategies in LC-MS mainly choose
    the most prominent peptide signals for MS/MS analysis. Consequently, high abundant
    proteins are identified by MS/MS of many peptides whereas proteins of lower abundance
    might elude identification. We present a novel, iterative and result-driven approach
    for precursor ion selection that significantly increases the efficiency of an
    MS/MS analysis by decreasing data redundancy and analysis time. By simulating
    different strategies for precursor ion selection on an existing dataset we compare
    our method to existing result-driven strategies and evaluate its performance with
    regard to mass accuracy, database size, and sample complexity.

    the small RNA content of a cell. Mapping the sequenced reads onto their reference

- abstract: "In electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI\u2212MS), peptide and\
    \ protein ions are usually observed in multiple charge states. Moreover, adduction\
    \ of the multiply charged species with other ions frequently results in quite\
    \ complex signal patterns for a single analyte, which significantly complicates\
    \ the derivation of quantitative information from the mass spectra. Labeling strategies\
    \ targeting the MS1 level further aggravate this situation, as multiple biological\
    \ states such as healthy or diseased must be represented simultaneously. We developed\
    \ an integer linear programming (ILP) approach, which can cluster signals belonging\
    \ to the same peptide or protein. The algorithm is general in that it models all\
    \ possible shifts of signals along the m/z axis. These shifts can be induced by\
    \ different charge states of the compound, the presence of adducts (e.g., potassium\
    \ or sodium), and/or a fixed mass label (e.g., from ICAT or nicotinic acid labeling),\
    \ or any combination of the above. We show that our approach can be used to infer\
    \ more features in labeled data sets, correct wrong charge assignments even in\
    \ high-resolution MS, improve mass precision, and cluster charged species in different\
    \ charge states and several adduct types."

- abstract: We describe an approach to parallel graph partitioning that scales to
    hundreds of processors and produces a high solution quality. For example, for
    many instances from Walshaw's benchmark collection we improve the best known partitioning.
    We use the well known framework of multi-level graph partitioning. All components
    are implemented by scalable parallel algorithms. Quality improvements compared
    to previous systems are due to better prioritization of edges to be contracted,
    better approximation algorithms for identifying matchings, better local search
    heuristics, and perhaps most notably, a parallelization of the FM local search
    algorithm that works more locally than previous approaches.

- abstract: Adeno-associated virus type 2 (AAV) is known to establish latency by preferential
    integration in human chromosome 19q13.42. The AAV non-structural protein Rep appears
    to target a site called AAVS1 by simultaneously binding to Rep-binding sites (RBS)
    present on the AAV genome and within AAVS1. In the absence of Rep, as is the case
    with AAV vectors, chromosomal integration is rare and random. For a genome-wide
    survey of wildtype AAV integration a linker-selection-mediated (LSM)-PCR strategy
    was designed to retrieve AAV-chromosomal junctions. DNA sequence determination
    revealed wildtype AAV integration sites scattered over the entire human genome.
    The bioinformatic analysis of these integration sites compared to those of rep-deficient
    AAV vectors revealed a highly significant overrepresentation of integration events
    near to consensus RBS. Integration hotspots included AAVS1 with 10% of total events.
    Novel hotspots near consensus RBS were identified on chromosome 5p13.3 denoted
    AAVS2 and on chromsome 3p24.3 denoted AAVS3. AAVS2 displayed seven independent
    junctions clustered within only 14 bp of a consensus RBS which proved to bind
    Rep in vitro similar to the RBS in AAVS3. Expression of Rep in the presence of
    rep-deficient AAV vectors shifted targeting preferences from random integration
    back to the neighbourhood of consensus RBS at hotspots and numerous additional
    sites in the human genome. In summary, targeted AAV integration is not as specific
    for AAVS1 as previously assumed. Rather, Rep targets AAV to integrate into open
    chromatin regions in the reach of various, consensus RBS homologues in the human
    genome.
