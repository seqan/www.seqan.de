  title: 17th International Workshop on Algorithms in Bioinformatics (WABI 2017)
  abstract: "This proceedings volume contains papers presented at the 17th Workshop
    on Algorithms in Bioinformatics (WABI 2017), which was held in Boston, MA, USA
    in conjunction with the 8th ACM Conference on Bioinformatics, Computational Biology,
    and Health Informatics (ACM BCB) from August 21–23, 2017.The Workshop on Algorithms
    in Bioinformatics is an annual conference established in 2001 to cover all aspects
    of algorithmic work in bioinformatics, computational biology, and systems biology.
    The workshop is intended as a forum for discrete algorithms and machine-learning
    methods that address important problems in molecular biology, that are founded
    on sound models, that are computationally efficient, and that have been implemented
    and tested in simulations and on real datasets. The meeting’s focus is on recent
    research results, including significant work-in-progress, as well as identifying
    and explore directions of future research.WABI 2017 is grateful for the support
    of ACM-BCB in allowing us to cohost the meetings, as well as to ACM-BCB’s sponsors:
    the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and ACM’s SIGBIO.In 2017, a
    total of 55 manuscripts were submitted to WABI from which 27 were selected for
    presentation at the conference. This year, WABI is adopting a new proceedings
    form, publishing the conference proceedings through the LIPIcs (Leibniz International
    Proceedings in Informatics) proceedings series. Extended versions of selected
    papers will be invited for publication in a thematic series in the journal Algorithms
    for Molecular Biology (AMB), published by BioMed Central.The 27 papers were
    selected based on a thorough peer review, involving at least three independent
    reviewers per submitted paper, followed by discussions among the WABI Program
    Committee members. The selected papers cover a wide range of topics, including
    statistical inference, phylogenetic studies, sequence and genome analysis, comparative
    genomics, and mass spectrometry data analysis.We thank all the authors of
    submitted papers and the members of the WABI Program Committee and their reviewers
    for their efforts that made this conference possible. We are also grateful to
    the WABI Steering Committee for their help and advice. We also thank all the conference
    participants and speakers who contribute to a great scientific program. Inparticular,
    we are indebted to the keynote speaker of the conference, Tandy Warnow, for her
    presentation. We also thank Christopher Pockrandt for setting up the WABI webpageand
    Umit Acar for his help with coordinating the WABI and ACM-BCB pages. Finally,
    we thank the ACM-BCB Organizing Committee, especially Nurit Haspel and Lenore
    Cowen,for their hard work in making all of the local arrangements and working
    closely with us to ensure a successful and exciting WABI and ACM-BCB."

  abstract: "Background: Proteases play an essential part in a variety of biological
    processes. Beside their importanceunder healthy conditions they are also known
    to have a crucial role in complex diseases like cancer.It was shown in the
    last years that not only the fragments produced by proteases but also their dynamics,especially
    ex vivo, can serve as biomarkers. But so far, only a few approaches were taken
    to explicitlymodel the dynamics of proteolysis in the context of mass spectrometry.Results:
    We introduce a new concept model proteolytic processes, the degradation graph.
    The degra-dation graph is an extension of the cleavage graph, a data structure
    to reconstruct and visualize theproteolytic process. In contrast to previous
    approaches we extended the model to incorporate endoproteolyticprocesses and
    present a method to construct a degradation graph from mass spectrometrytime-series
    data. Based on a degradation graph and the intensities extracted from the mass
    spectra it ispossible to estimate reaction rates of the underlying processes.
    We further suggest a score to rate differentdegradation graphs in their ability
    to explain the observed data. This score is used in an iterativeheuristic
    to improve the structure of the initially constructed degradation graph.Conclusion:
    We show that the proposed method is able to recover all degraded and generatedpeptides,
    the underlying reactions, and the reaction rates of proteolytic processes based
    on mass spectrometrytime-series data. We use simulated and real data to demonstrate
    that a given process can bereconstructed even in the presence of extensive
    noise, isobaric signals and false identications. While themodel is currently
    only validated on peptide data it is also applicable to proteins, as long as the
    necessarytime series data can be produced."

  abstract: 'MS-based proteomics and metabolomics are rapidly evolving research fields
    driven by the development of novel instruments, experimental approaches, and analysis
    methods. Monolithic analysis tools perform well on single tasks but lack the flexibility
    to cope with the constantly changing requirements and experimental setups. Workflow
    systems, which combine small processing tools into complex analysis pipelines,
    allow custom-tailored and flexible data-processing workflows that can be published
    or shared with collaborators. In this article, we present the integration of established
    tools for computational MS from the open-source software framework OpenMS into
    the workflow engine Konstanz Information Miner (KNIME) for the analysis of large
    datasets and production of high-quality visualizations. We provide example workflows
    to demonstrate combined data processing and visualization for three diverse tasks
    in computational MS: isobaric mass tag based quantitation in complex experimental
    setups, label-free quantitation and identification of metabolites, and quality
    control for proteomics experiments.'

  abstract: Peptide sequencing from mass spectrometry data is a key step in proteome
    research. Especially de novo sequencing, the identification of a peptide from
    its spectrum alone, is still a challenge even for state-of-the-art algorithmic
    approaches. In this paper we present ANTILOPE, a new fast and flexible approach
    based on mathematical programming. It builds on the spectrum graph model and works
    with a variety of scoring schemes. ANTILOPE combines Lagrangian relaxation for
    solving an integer linear programming formulation with an adaptation of Yen’s
    k shortest paths algorithm. It shows a significant improvement in running time
    compared to mixed integer optimization and performs at the same speed like other
    state-of-the-art tools. We also implemented a generic probabilistic scoring scheme
    that can be trained automatically for a dataset of annotated spectra and is independent
    of the mass spectrometer type. Evaluations on benchmark data show that ANTILOPE
    is competitive to the popular state-of-the-art programs PepNovo and NovoHMM both
    in terms of run time and accuracy. Furthermore, it offers increased flexibility
    in the number of considered ion types. ANTILOPE will be freely available as part
    of the open source proteomics library OpenMS.

  title: 'The duplication-loss small phylogeny problem: from cherries to trees.'
  abstract: Abstract The reconstruction of the history of evolutionary genome-wide
    events among a set of related organisms is of great biological interest since
    it can help to reveal the genomic basis of phenotypes. The sequencing of whole
    genomes faciliates the study of gene families that vary in size through duplication
    and loss events, like transfer RNA. However, a high sequence similarity often
    does not allow one to distinguish between orthologs and paralogs. Previous methods
    have addressed this difficulty by taking into account flanking regions of members
    of a family independently. We go one step further by inferring the order of genes
    of (a set of) families for ancestral genomes by considering the order of these
    genes on sequenced genomes. We present a novel branch-and-cut algorithm to solve
    the two species small phylogeny problem in the evolutionary model of duplications
    and losses. On average, our implementation, DupLoCut, improves the running time
    of a recently proposed method in the experiments on six Vibrionaceae lineages
    by a factor of Ã¢&lt;88&gt;Â¼200. Besides the mere improvement in running time,
    the efficiency of our approach allows us to extend our model from cherries of
    a species tree, that is, subtrees with two leaves, to the median of three species
    setting. Being able to determine the median of three species is of key importance
    to one of the most common approaches to ancestral reconstruction, and our experiments
    show that its repeated computation considerably reduces the number of duplications
    and losses along the tree both on simulated instances comprising 128 leaves and
    a set of Bacillus genomes. Furthermore, in our simulations we show that a reduction
    in cost goes hand in hand with an improvement of the predicted ancestral genomes.
    Finally, we prove that the small phylogeny problem in the duplication-loss model
    is NP-complete already for two species.

  title: In-depth analysis of protein inference algorithms using multiple search engines
    and well-defined metrics
  abstract: 'In mass spectrometry-based shotgun proteomics, protein identifications
    are usually the desired result. However, most of the analytical methods are based
    on the identification of reliable peptides and not the direct identification of
    intact proteins. Thus, assembling peptides identified from tandem mass spectra
    into a list of proteins, referred to as protein inference, is a critical step
    in proteomics research. Currently, different protein inference algorithms and
    tools are available for the proteomics community. Here, we evaluated five software
    tools for protein inference (PIA, ProteinProphet, Fido, ProteinLP, MSBayesPro)
    using three popular database search engines: Mascot, X!Tandem, and MS-GF +. All
    the algorithms were evaluated using a highly customizable KNIME workflow using
    four different public datasets with varying complexities (different sample preparation,
    species and analytical instruments). We defined a set of quality control metrics
    to evaluate the performance of each combination of search engines, protein inference
    algorithm, and parameters on each dataset. We show that the results for complex
    samples vary not only regarding the actual numbers of reported protein groups
    but also concerning the actual composition of groups. Furthermore, the robustness
    of reported proteins when using databases of differing complexities is strongly
    dependant on the applied inference algorithm. Finally, merging the identifications
    of multiple search engines does not necessarily increase the number of reported
    proteins, but does increase the number of peptides per protein and thus can generally
    be recommended.'

  abstract: "This work presents a generalized approach for the fast structural alignment
    of thousands of macromolecular structures. The method uses string representations
    of a macromolecular structure and a hash table that stores n-grams of a certain
    size for searching. To this end, macromolecular structure-to-string translators
    were implemented for protein and RNA structures. A query against the index is
    performed in two hierarchical steps to unite speed and precision. In the ﬁrst
    step the query structure is translated into n-grams, and all target structures
    containing these n-grams are retrieved from the hash table. In the second step
    all corresponding n-grams of the query and each target structure are subsequently
    aligned, and after each alignment a score is calculated based on the matching
    n-grams of query and target. The extendable framework enables the user to query
    and structurally align thousands of protein and RNA structures on a commodity
    machine and is available as open source from http://la jolla.sf.net. "

  title: Bioinformatics for qualitative and quantitative proteomics.
  status_changed: '2011-04-29 12:38:12'
  abstract: Mass spectrometry is today a key analytical technique to elucidate the
    amount and content of proteins expressed in a certain cellular context. The degree
    of automation in proteomics has yet to reach that of genomic techniques, but even
    current technologies make a manual inspection of the data infeasible. This article
    addresses the key algorithmic problems bioinformaticians face when handling modern
    proteomic samples and shows common solutions to them. We provide examples on how
    algorithms can be combined to build relatively complex analysis pipelines, point
    out certain pitfalls and aspects worth considering and give a list of current
    state-of-the-art tools.

  title: Optimal Decharging and Clustering of Charge Ladders Generated in ESI−MS
  abstract: In electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI−MS), peptide and protein
    ions are usually observed in multiple charge states. Moreover, adduction of the
    multiply charged species with other ions frequently results in quite complex signal
    patterns for a single analyte, which significantly complicates the derivation
    of quantitative information from the mass spectra. Labeling strategies targeting
    the MS1 level further aggravate this situation, as multiple biological states
    such as healthy or diseased must be represented simultaneously. We developed an
    integer linear programming (ILP) approach, which can cluster signals belonging
    to the same peptide or protein. The algorithm is general in that it models all
    possible shifts of signals along the m/z axis. These shifts can be induced by
    different charge states of the compound, the presence of adducts (e.g., potassium
    or sodium), and/or a fixed mass label (e.g., from ICAT or nicotinic acid labeling),
    or any combination of the above. We show that our approach can be used to infer
    more features in labeled data sets, correct wrong charge assignments even in high-resolution
    MS, improve mass precision, and cluster charged species in different charge states
    and several adduct types.

  title: Quantification and Simulation of Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry
    Data
  abstract: "Computational mass spectrometry is a fast evolving field that has attracted
    increased attention over the last couple of years.The performance of software
    solutions determines the success of analysis to a great extent. New algorithms
    are required to reflect new experimental procedures and deal with new instrument
    generations.One essential component of algorithm development is the validation
    (as well as comparison) of software on a broad range ofdata sets. This requires
    a gold standard (or so-called ground truth), which is usually obtained by manual
    annotation of a real data set.Comprehensive manually annotated public data
    sets for mass spectrometry data are labor-intensive to produce and their quality
    strongly depends on the skill of the human expert. Some parts of the data
    may even be impossible to annotate due to high levels of noise or other ambiguities.Furthermore,
    manually annotated data is usually not available for all steps in a typical computational
    analysis pipeline.We thus developed the most comprehensive simulation software
    to date, which allows to generate multiple levels of ground truthand features
    a plethora of settings to reflect experimental conditions and instrument settings.The
    simulator is used to generate several distinct types of data. The data are subsequently
    employed to evaluate existing algorithms.Additionally, we employ simulation
    to determine the influence of instrument attributes and sample complexity on the
    ability ofalgorithms to recover information. The results give valuable hints
    on how to optimize experimental setups.Furthermore, this thesis introduces
    two quantitative approaches, namely a decharging algorithm based on integer linear
    programming and a new workflow for identification of differentially expressed
    proteins for a large in vitro study on toxic compounds.Decharging infers the
    uncharged mass of a peptide (or protein) by clustering all its charge variants.
    The latter occur frequently under certain experimental conditions.We employ
    simulation to show that decharging is robust against missing values even for high
    complexity data and that the algorithm outperformsother solutions in terms
    of mass accuracy and run time on real data.The last part of this thesis deals
    with a new state-of-the-art workflow for protein quantification based on isobaric
    tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ). We devisea new approach
    to isotope correction, propose an experimental design, introduce new metrics of
    iTRAQ data quality, andconfirm putative properties of iTRAQ data using a novel
    approach.All tools developed as part of this thesis are implemented in
    OpenMS, a C++ library for computational mass spectrometry."

  title: 'MSSimulator: Simulation of Mass Spectrometry Data'
  status_changed: '2011-11-28 09:09:08'
  abstract: Mass spectrometry coupled to liquid chromatography (LC-MS and LC-MS/MS)
    is commonly used to analyze the protein content of biological samples in large
    scale studies, enabling quantitation and identification of proteins and peptides
    using a wide range of experimental protocols, algorithms, and statistical models
    to analyze the data. Currently it is difficult to compare the plethora of algorithms
    for these tasks. So far, curated benchmark data exists for peptide identification
    algorithms but data that represents a ground truth for the evaluation of LC-MS
    data is limited. Hence there have been attempts to simulate such data in a controlled
    fashion to evaluate and compare algorithms. We present MSSimulator, a simulation
    software for LC-MS and LC-MS/MS experiments. Starting from a list of proteins
    from a FASTA file,the simulation will perform in-silico digestion, retention time
    prediction,  ionization filtering, and raw signal simulation (including MS/MS),
    while providing many options to change the properties of the resultingdata like
    elution profile shape, resolution and sampling rate. Several protocols for SILAC,
    iTRAQ or MS(E) are available, in addition to the usual label-free approach, making
    MSSimulator the most comprehensive simulator for LC-MS and LC-MS/MS data.

  status_changed: '2009-03-11 11:26:53'
  abstract: "We present an expected polynomial time algorithm to generate an unlabeledconnected
    cubic planar graph uniformly at random. We first considerrooted cubic planar
    graphs, i.e., we count connected cubic planargraphs up to isomorphisms that
    fix a certain directed edge. Basedon decompositions along the connectivity
    structure, we derive recurrenceformulas for counting the exact number of
    rooted cubic planar graphs.This leads to 3-connected planar graphs, which
    have a unique embeddingon the sphere; but special care has to be taken for
    rooted graphsthat have a sense-reversing automorphism. Therefore we introducethe
    concept of colored networks, which stand in bijective correspondenceto rooted
    graphs with given symmetries. Colored networks can againbe decomposed along
    their connectivity structure. For rooted 3-connectedcubic planar graphs
    embedded in the plane, we switch to the dualand count rooted triangulations.
    All these numbers can be evaluatedin polynomial time by dynamic programming.
    We can use them to generaterooted cubic planar graphs uniformly at random.

  abstract: Francisella (F.) tularensis is a highly virulent, Gram-negative bacterial
    pathogen and the causative agent of the zoonotic disease tularemia. Here, we generated,
    analyzed and characterized a high quality circular genome sequence of the F. tularensis
    subsp. holarctica strain 12T0050 that caused fatal tularemia in a hare. Besides
    the genomic structure, we focused on the analysis of oriC, unique to the Francisella
    genus and regulating replication in and outside hosts and the first report on
    genomic DNA methylation of a Francisella strain. The high quality genome was used
    to establish and evaluate a diagnostic whole genome sequencing pipeline. A genotyping
    strategy for F. tularensis was developed using various bioinformatics tools for
    genotyping. Additionally, whole genome sequences of F. tularensis subsp. holarctica
    isolates isolated in the years 2008–2015 in Germany were generated. A phylogenetic
    analysis allowed to determine the genetic relatedness of these isolates and confirmed
    the highly conserved nature of F. tularensis subsp. holarctica.

  title: Determination of Glycan Structure from Tandem Mass Spectra
  abstract: Glycans are molecules made from simple sugars that form complex tree structures.
    Glycans constitute one of the most important protein modifications and identification
    of glycans remains a pressing problem in biology. Unfortunately, the structure
    of glycans is hard to predict from the genome sequence of an organism. In this
    paper, we consider the problem of deriving the topology of a glycan solely from
    tandem mass spectrometry (MS) data. We study, how to generate glycan tree candidates
    that sufficiently match the sample mass spectrum, avoiding the combinatorial explosion
    of glycan structures. Unfortunately, the resulting problem is known to be computationally
    hard. We present an efficient exact algorithm for this problem based on fixed-parameter
    algorithmics that can process a spectrum in a matter of seconds. We also report
    some preliminary results of our method on experimental data, combining it with
    a preliminary candidate evaluation scheme. We show that our approach is fast in
    applications, and that we can reach very well de novo identification results.
    Finally, we show how to count the number of glycan topologies for a fixed size
    or a fixed mass. We generalize this result to count the number of (labeled) trees
    with bounded out degree, improving on results obtained using Pólya's enumeration
    theorem.

  abstract: We present CIDANE, a novel framework for genome-based transcript reconstruction
    and quantification from RNA-seq reads. CIDANE assembles transcripts efficiently
    with significantly higher sensitivity and precision than existing tools. Its algorithmic
    core not only reconstructs transcripts ab initio, but also allows the use of the
    growing annotation of known splice sites, transcription start and end sites, or
    full-length transcripts, which are available for most model organisms. CIDANE
    supports the integrated analysis of RNA-seq and additional gene-boundary data
    and recovers splice junctions that are invisible to other methods. CIDANE is available
    at http://​ccb.​jhu.​edu/​software/​cidane/​.

  title: 'SLIMM: species level identification of microorganisms from metagenomes'
  abstract: Identification and quantification of microorganisms is a significant step
    in studying the alpha and beta diversities within and between microbial communities
    respectively. Both identification and quantification of a given microbial community
    can be carried out using whole genome shotgun sequences with less bias than when
    using 16S-rDNA sequences. However, shared regions of DNA among reference genomes
    and taxonomic units pose a significant challenge in assigning reads correctly
    to their true origins. The existing microbial community profiling tools commonly
    deal with this problem by either preparing signature-based unique references or
    assigning an ambiguous read to its least common ancestor in a taxonomic tree.
    The former method is limited to making use of the reads which can be mapped to
    the curated regions, while the latter suffer from the lack of uniquely mapped
    reads at lower (more specific) taxonomic ranks. Moreover, even if the tools exhibited
    good performance in calling the organisms present in a sample, there is still
    room for improvement in determining the correct relative abundance of the organisms.
    We present a new method Species Level Identification of Microorganisms from Metagenomes
    (SLIMM) which addresses the above issues by using coverage information of reference
    genomes to remove unlikely genomes from the analysis and subsequently gain more
    uniquely mapped reads to assign at lower ranks of a taxonomic tree. SLIMM is based
    on a few, seemingly easy steps which when combined create a tool that outperforms
    state-of-the-art tools in run-time and memory usage while being on par or better
    in computing quantitative and qualitative information at species-level.

  title: 'DREAM-Yara: an exact read mapper for very large databases with short update
    time'
  abstract: "MotivationMapping-based approaches have become limited in their
    application to very large sets of references since computing an FM-index for very
    large databases (e.g. >10 GB) has become a bottleneck. This affects many analyses
    that need such index as an essential step for approximate matching of the NGS
    reads to reference databases. For instance, in typical metagenomics analysis,
    the size of the reference sequences has become prohibitive to compute a single
    full-text index on standard machines. Even on large memory machines, computing
    such index takes about 1 day of computing time. As a result, updates of indices
    are rarely performed. Hence, it is desirable to create an alternative way of indexing
    while preserving fast search times.ResultsTo solve the index construction
    and update problem we propose the DREAM (Dynamic seaRchablE pArallel coMpressed
    index) framework and provide an implementation. The main contributions are the
    introduction of an approximate search distributor via a novel use of Bloom filters.
    We combine several Bloom filters to form an interleaved Bloom filter and use this
    new data structure to quickly exclude reads for parts of the databases where they
    cannot match. This allows us to keep the databases in several indices which can
    be easily rebuilt if parts are updated while maintaining a fast search time. The
    second main contribution is an implementation of DREAM-Yara a distributed version
    of a fully sensitive read mapper under the DREAM framework.Availability

  abstract: BACKGROUND:The use of novel algorithmic techniques is pivotal to many
    important problems in life science. For example the sequencing of the human genome
    [1] would not have been possible without advanced assembly algorithms. However,
    owing to the high speed of technological progress and the urgent need for bioinformatics
    tools, there is a widening gap between state-of-the-art algorithmic techniques
    and the actual algorithmic components of tools that are in widespread use.RESULTS:To
    remedy this trend we propose the use of SeqAn, a library of efficient data types
    and algorithms for sequence analysis in computational biology. SeqAn comprises
    implementations of existing, practical state-of-the-art algorithmic components
    to provide a sound basis for algorithm testing and development. In this paper
    we describe the design and content of SeqAn and demonstrate its use by giving
    two examples. In the first example we show an application of SeqAn as an experimental
    platform by comparing different exact string matching algorithms. The second example
    is a simple version of the well-known MUMmer tool rewritten in SeqAn. Results
    indicate that our implementation is very efficient and versatile to use.CONCLUSION:We
    anticipate that SeqAn greatly simplifies the rapid development of new bioinformatics
    tools by providing a collection of readily usable, well-designed algorithmic components
    which are fundamental for the field of sequence analysis. This leverages not only
    the implementation of new algorithms, but also enables a sound analysis and comparison
    of existing algorithms.

  abstract: 'Motivation: Deep sequencing has become the method of choice for determining
    the small RNA content of a cell. Mapping the sequenced reads onto their reference
    genome serves as the basis for all further analyses, namely for identification
    and quantification. A method frequently used is Mega BLAST followed by several
    filtering steps, even though it is slow and inefficient for this task. Also, none
    of the currently available short read aligners has established itself for the
    particular task of small RNA mapping.  Results: We present MicroRazerS, a tool
    optimized for mapping small RNAs onto a reference genome. It is an order of magnitude
    faster than Mega BLAST and comparable in speed to other short read mapping tools.
    In addition, it is more sensitive and easy to handle and adjust.  Availability:

  title: Detecting genomic indel variants with exact breakpoints in single- and paired-end
    sequencing data using SplazerS
  abstract: "Motivation: The reliable detection of genomic variation in resequencing
    data is still a major challenge, especially for variants larger than a few base
    pairs. Sequencing reads crossing boundaries of structural variation carry the
    potential for their identification, but are difficult to map.Results:
    Here we present a method for ‘split’ read mapping, where prefix and suffix match
    of a read may be interrupted by a longer gap in the read-to-reference alignment.
    We use this method to accurately detect medium-sized insertions and long deletions
    with precise breakpoints in genomic resequencing data. Compared with alternative
    split mapping methods, SplazerS significantly improves sensitivity for detecting
    large indel events, especially in variant-rich regions. Our method is robust in
    the presence of sequencing errors as well as alignment errors due to genomic mutations/divergence,
    and can be used on reads of variable lengths. Our analysis shows that SplazerS
    is a versatile tool applicable to unanchored or single-end as well as anchored
    paired-end reads. In addition, application of SplazerS to targeted resequencing
    data led to the interesting discovery of a complete, possibly functional gene
    retrocopy variant.Availability: SplazerS is available from http://www.seqan.de/projects/
    splazers."

  abstract: "Mass spectrometry (MS) is becoming a popular approach for quantifyingthe
    protein composition of complex samples. A great challenge forcomparative
    proteomic profiling is to match corresponding peptidefeatures from different
    experiments to ensure that the same proteinintensities are correctly identified.
    Multi-dimensional data acquisitionfrom liquid-chromatography mass spectrometry
    (LC-MS) makes the alignmentproblem harder. We propose a general paradigm
    for aligning peptidefeatures using a bounded error model. Our method is
    tolerant of imperfectmeasurements, missing peaks, and extraneous peaks.
    It can handlean arbitrary number of dimensions of separation, and is very
    fastin practice even for large data sets. Finally, its parameters areintuitive
    and we describe a heuristic for estimating them automatically.We demonstrate
    results on single- and multi-dimensional data."

  abstract: "Motivation: The Dictionary of Interfaces in Proteins (DIP) is a databasecollecting
    the 3D structure of interacting parts of proteins thatare called patches.
    It serves as a repository, in which patches similarto given query patches
    can be found. The computation of the similarityof two patches is time consuming
    and traversing the entire DIP requiressome hours. In this work we address
    the question of how the patchessimilar to a given query can be identified
    by scanning only a smallpart of DIP. The answer to this question requires
    the investigationof the distribution of the similarity of patches. Results:
    The scorevalues describing the similarity of two patches can roughly be
    dividedinto three ranges that correspond to different levels of spatialsimilarity.
    Interestingly, the two iso-score lines separating thethree classes can be
    determined by two different approaches. Applyinga concept of the theory
    of random graphs reveals significant structuralproperties of the data in
    DIP. These can be used to accelerate scanningthe DIP for patches similar
    to a given query. Searches for very similarpatches could be accelerated
    by a factor of more than 25. Patcheswith a medium similarity could be found
    10 times faster than by brute-forcesearch. 10.1093/bioinformatics/btg343"

  title: Biological Sequence Analysis using the SeqAn C++ Library
  status_changed: '2010-03-04 12:10:11'
  abstract: "Before the SeqAn project, there was clearly a lack of available implementations
    in sequence analysis, even for standard tasks. Implementations of needed algorithmic
    components were either unavailable or hard to access in third-party monolithic
    software products. Addressing these concerns, the developers of SeqAn created
    a comprehensive, easy-to-use, open source C++ library of efficient algorithms
    and data structures for the analysis of biological sequences. Written by the founders
    of this project, Biological Sequence Analysis Using the SeqAn C++ Library covers
    the SeqAn library, its documentation, and the supporting infrastructure.The
    first part of the book describes the general library design. It introduces biological
    sequence analysis problems, discusses the benefit of using software libraries,
    summarizes the design principles and goals of SeqAn, details the main programming
    techniques used in SeqAn, and demonstrates the application of these techniques
    in various examples. Focusing on the components provided by SeqAn, the second
    part explores basic functionality, sequence data structures, alignments, pattern
    and motif searching, string indices, and graphs. The last part illustrates applications
    of SeqAn to genome alignment, consensus sequence in assembly projects, suffix
    array construction, and more.This handy book describes a user-friendly
    library of efficient data types and algorithms for sequence analysis in computational
    biology. SeqAn enables not only the implementation of new algorithms, but also
    the sound analysis and comparison of existing algorithms."

  abstract: Spontaneous outbreaks of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) occur in
    neonatal piglets, but the predisposing factors are largely not known. To study
    the conditions for C. difficile colonization and CDI development, 48 neonatal
    piglets were moved into isolators, fed bovine milk–based formula, and infected
    with C. difficile 078. Analyses included clinical scoring; measurement of the
    fecal C. difficile burden, toxin B level, and calprotectin level; and postmortem
    histopathological analysis of colon specimens. Controls were noninfected suckling
    piglets. Fecal specimens from suckling piglets, formula-fed piglets, and formula-fed,
    C. difficile–infected piglets were used for metagenomics analysis. High background
    levels of C. difficile and toxin were detected in formula-fed piglets prior to
    infection, while suckling piglets carried about 3-fold less C. difficile, and
    toxin was not detected. Toxin level in C. difficile–challenged animals correlated
    positively with C. difficile and calprotectin levels. Postmortem signs of CDI
    were absent in suckling piglets, whereas mesocolonic edema and gas-filled distal
    small intestines and ceca, cellular damage, and reduced expression of claudins
    were associated with animals from the challenge trials. Microbiota in formula-fed
    piglets was enriched with Escherichia, Shigella, Streptococcus, Enterococcus,
    and Ruminococcus species. Formula-fed piglets were predisposed to C. difficile
    colonization earlier as compared to suckling piglets. Infection with a hypervirulent
    C. difficile ribotype did not aggravate the symptoms of infection. Sow-offspring
    association and consumption of porcine milk during early life may be crucial for
    the control of C. difficile expansion in piglets.

  abstract: "(deutsche Zusammenfassung siehe unten)&lt;p&gt; Binary Decision Diagrams(BDDs)
    are a data structure for Boolean functions which are alsoknown as branching
    programs. In ordered binary decision diagrams(OBDDs), the tests have to
    obey a fixed variable ordering. In freebinary decision diagrams (FBDDs),
    each variable can be tested atmost once. The efficiency of new variants
    of the BDD concept is usuallydemonstrated with spectacular (worst-case)
    examples. We pursue anotherapproach and compare the representation sizes
    of almost all Booleanfunctions. Whereas I. Wegener proved that for `most'
    values of nthe expected OBDD size of a random Boolean function of n variablesis
    equal to the worst-case size up to terms of lower order, we showthat this
    is not the case for n within intervals of constant lengtharound the values
    n = 2h + h. Furthermore, ranges of n exist forwhich minimal FBDDs are almost
    always at least a constant factorsmaller than minimal OBDDs. Our main theorems
    have doubly exponentiallysmall probability bounds (in n). We also investigate
    the evolutionof random OBDDs and their worst-case size, revealing an oscillatingbehaviour
    that explains why certain results cannot be improved ingeneral. &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;Zusammenfassung:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt; Binary Decision Diagrams(BDDs)
    sind eine Datenstruktur für Boolesche Funktionen, dieauch unter dem Namen
    branching program bekannt ist. In ordered binarydecision diagrams (OBDDs)
    müssen die Tests einer festen Variablenordnunggenügen. In free binary decision
    diagrams (FBDDs) darf jede Variablehöchstens einmal getestet werden. Die
    Effizienz neuer Variantendes BDD-Konzepts wird gewöhnlich anhand spektakulärer
    (worst-case)Beispiele aufgezeigt. Wir verfolgen einen anderen Ansatz und
    vergleichendie Darstellungsgrößen für fast alle Booleschen Funktionen.Während
    I. Wegener bewiesen hat, daß für die `meisten'n die erwartete OBDD-Größe
    einer zufälligen BooleschenFunktion von n Variablen gleich der worst-case
    Größe bisauf Terme kleinerer Ordnung ist, zeigen wir daß dies nicht derFall
    ist für n innerhalb von Intervallen konstanter Längeum die Werte n = 2h
    + h. Ferner gibt es Bereiche von n, in denenminimale FBDDs fast immer um
    mindestens einen konstanten Faktor kleinersind als minimale OBDDs. Unsere
    Hauptsätze ha ben doppelt exponentielleWahrschein- lichkeitsschranken (in
    n). Außerdem untersuchen wirdie Entwicklung zufälliger OBDDs und ihrer worst-case
    Größeund decken dabei ein oszillierendes Verhalten auf, das erklärt,warum
    gewisse Aussagen im allgemeinen nicht verstärkt werdenkönnen. &lt;p&gt;Schlagwörter:&lt;p&gt;

  title: "Lower bounds for approximation algorithms for the Steiner treeproblem"
  status_changed: '2009-03-11 11:27:00'
  abstract: "The Steiner tree problem asks for a shortest subgraph connecting agiven
    set of terminals in a graph. It is known to be APX-complete,which means
    that no polynomial time approximation scheme can existfor this problem,
    unless P=NP. Currently, the best approximationalgorithm for the Steiner
    tree problem has a performance ratio of<span class='mathrm'>1.55</span>,
    whereas the corresponding lower bound is smaller than <span class='mathrm'>1.01</span>.In
    this paper, we provide for several Steiner tree approximationalgorithms
    lower bounds on their performance ratio that are muchlarger. For two algorithms
    that solve the Steiner tree problem onquasi-bipartite instances, we even
    prove lower bounds that matchthe upper bounds. Quasi-bipartite instances
    are of special interest,as currently all known lower bound reductions for
    the Steiner treeproblem in graphs produce such instances."

  title: Steiner trees in uniformly quasi-bipartite graphs
  status_changed: '2009-03-11 11:27:00'
  abstract: "The area of approximation algorithms for the Steiner tree problemin
    graphs has seen continuous progress over the last years. Currentlythe best
    approximation algorithm has a performance ratio of 1.550.This is still far
    away from 1.0074, the largest known lower boundon the achievable performance
    ratio. As all instances resulting fromknown lower bound reductions are uniformly
    quasi-bipartite, it isinteresting whether this special case can be approximated
    betterthan the general case. We present an approximation algorithm withperformance
    ratio 73/60 &lt; 1.217 for the uniformly quasi-bipartitecase. This improves
    on the previously known ratio of 1.279 of Robinsand Zelikovsky. We use a
    new method of analysis that combines ideasfrom the greedy algorithm for
    set cover with a matroid-style exchangeargument to model the connectivity
    constraint. As a consequence,we are able to provide a tight instance."

  abstract: "HPLC-ESI-MS is rapidly becoming an established standard method forshotgun
    proteomics. Currently, its major drawbacks are twofold: quantificationis
    mostly limited to relative quantification and the large amountof data produced
    by every individual experiment can make manual analysisquite difficult.
    Here we present a new, combined experimental andalgorithmic approach to
    absolutely quantify proteins from sampleswith unprecedented precision. We
    apply the method to the analysisof myoglobin in human blood serum, which
    is an important diagnosticmarker for myocardial infarction. Our approach
    was able to determinethe absolute amount of myoglobin in a serum sample
    through a seriesof standard addition experiments with a relative error of
    2.5 percent.Compared to a manual analysis of the same dataset we could improvethe
    precision and conduct it in a fraction of the time needed forthe manual
    analysis. We anticipate that our automatic quantitationmethod will facilitate
    further absolute or relative quantitationof even more complex peptide samples.
    The algorithm was developedusing our publically available software framework
    OpenMS (www.openms.de)."

  title: Ordered binary decision diagrams and the Shannon effect
  abstract: "We investigate the size and structure of ordered binary decision diagrams(OBDDs)
    for random Boolean functions. It was known that for mostvalues of n, the
    expected OBDD size of a random Boolean functionwith n variables is equal
    to the worst-case size up to terms of lowerorder. Such a phenomenon is generally
    called strong Shannon effect.Here we show that the strong Shannon effect
    is not valid for alln. Instead it undergoes a certain periodic `phase transition':
    Ifn lies within intervals of constant width around the values n = 2h+
    h, then the strong Shannon effect does not hold, whereas it doeshold outside
    these intervals. Our analysis provides doubly exponentialprobability bounds
    and generalises to ordered Kronecker functionaldecision diagrams (OKFDDs). "

  abstract: "MOTIVATION:Next-generation sequencing technologies produce unprecedented
    amounts of data, leading to completely new research fields. One of these is metagenomics,
    the study of large-size DNA samples containing a multitude of diverse organisms.
    A key problem in metagenomics is to functionally and taxonomically classify the
    sequenced DNA, to which end the well-known BLAST program is usually used. But
    BLAST has dramatic resource requirements at metagenomic scales of data, imposing
    a high financial or technical burden on the researcher. Multiple attempts have
    been made to overcome these limitations and  present a viable alternative to BLAST.RESULTS:In
    this work we present Lambda, our own alternative for BLAST in the context of sequence
    classification. In our tests, Lambda often outperforms the best tools at reproducing
    BLAST's results and is the fastest compared with the current state of the art
    at comparable levels of sensitivity.AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION:Lambda

  abstract: "BackgroundSecond generation sequencing technologies yield DNA sequence
    data at ultra high-throughput. Common to most biological applications is a mapping
    of the reads to an almost identical or highly similar reference genome. The assessment
    of the quality of read mapping results is not straightforward and has not been
    formalized so far. Hence, it has not been easy to compare different read mapping
    approaches in a unified way and to determine which program is the best for what
    task.ResultsWe present a new benchmark method, called Rabema (Read
    Alignment BEnchMArk), for read mappers. It consists of a strict definition of
    the read mapping problem and of tools to evaluate the result of arbitrary read
    mappers supporting the SAM output format.ConclusionsWe show the usefulness
    of the benchmark program by performing a comparison of popular read mappers. The
    tools supporting the benchmark are licensed under the GPL and available from http://www.seqan.de/projects/rabema.html."

  title: Methods for the Detection and Assembly of Novel Sequence in High-Throughput
    Sequencing Data
  status_changed: '2016-02-25 11:13:53'
  abstract: "Motivation: Large insertions of novel sequence are an important type
    of structural variants. Previous studies used traditional de novo assemblers for
    assembling non-mapping high-throughput sequencing (HTS) or capillary reads and
    then tried to anchor them in the reference using paired read information.Results:
    We present approaches for detecting insertion breakpoints and targeted assembly
    of large insertions from HTS paired data: BASIL and ANISE. On near identity repeats
    that are hard for assemblers, ANISE employs a repeat resolution step. This results
    in far better reconstructions than obtained by the compared methods. On simulated
    data, we found our insert assembler to be competitive with the de novo assemblers
    ABYSS and SGA while yielding already anchored inserted sequence as opposed to
    unanchored contigs as from ABYSS/SGA. On real-world data, we detected novel sequence
    in a human individual and thoroughly validated the assembled sequence. ANISE was
    found to be superior to the competing tool MindTheGap on both simulated and real-world
    data.Availability and implementation: ANISE and BASIL are available for
    download at http://www.seqan.de/projects/herbarium under a permissive open source

  title: Engineering a scalable high quality graph partitioner
  abstract: We describe an approach to parallel graph partitioning that scales to
    hundreds of processors and produces a high solution quality. For example, for
    many instances from Walshaw's benchmark collection we improve the best known partitioning.
    We use the well known framework of multi-level graph partitioning. All components
    are implemented by scalable parallel algorithms. Quality improvements compared
    to previous systems are due to better prioritization of edges to be contracted,
    better approximation algorithms for identifying matchings, better local search
    heuristics, and perhaps most notably, a parallelization of the FM local search
    algorithm that works more locally than previous approaches.

  title: 'NetCoffee: a fast and accurate global alignment approach to identify functionally
    conserved proteins in multiple networks'
  abstract: "Motivation: Owing to recent advancements in high-throughput technologies,
    protein–protein interaction networks of more and more species become available
    in public databases. The question of how to identify functionally conserved proteins
    across species attracts a lot of attention in computational biology. Network alignments
    provide a systematic way to solve this problem. However, most existing alignment
    tools encounter limitations in tackling this problem. Therefore, the demand for
    faster and more efficient alignment tools is growing.Results: We present
    a fast and accurate algorithm, NetCoffee, which allows to find a global alignment
    of multiple protein–protein interaction networks. NetCoffee searches for a global
    alignment by maximizing a target function using simulated annealing on a set of
    weighted bipartite graphs that are constructed using a triplet approach similar
    to T-Coffee. To assess its performance, NetCoffee was applied to four real datasets.
    Our results suggest that NetCoffee remedies several limitations of previous algorithms,
    outperforms all existing alignment tools in terms of speed and nevertheless identifies
    biologically meaningful alignments.Availability: The source code and data

  title: 'LocalAli: An Evolutionary-based Local Alignment Approach to Identify Functionally
    Conserved Modules in Multiple Networks.'
  abstract: "MOTIVATION:Sequences and protein interaction data are of significance
    to understand the underlying molecular mechanism of organisms. Local network alignment
    is one of key systematic ways for predicting protein functions, identifying functional
    modules, and understanding the phylogeny from these data. Most of currently existing
    tools, however, encounter their limitations which are mainly concerned with scoring
    scheme, speed and scalability. Therefore, there are growing demands for sophisticated
    network evolution models and efficient local alignment algorithms.RESULTS:We
    developed a fast and scalable local network alignment tool so-called LocalAli
    for the identification of functionally conserved modules in multiple networks.
    In this algorithm, we firstly proposed a new framework to reconstruct the evolution
    history of conserved modules based on a maximum-parsimony evolutionary model.
    By relying on this model, LocalAli facilitates interpretation of resulting local
    alignments in terms of conserved modules which have been evolved from a common
    ancestral module through a series of evolutionary events. A meta-heuristic method
    simulated annealing was used to search for the optimal or near-optimal inner nodes
    (i.e. ancestral modules) of the evolutionary tree. To evaluate the performance
    and the statistical significance, LocalAli were tested on a total of 26 real datasets
    and 1040 randomly generated datasets. The results suggest that LocalAli outperforms
    all existing algorithms in terms of coverage, consistency and scalability, meanwhile
    retains a high precision in the identification of functionally coherent subnetworks.AVAILABILITY:The
    source code and test datasets are freely available for download under the GNU
    GPL v3 license at https://code.google.com/p/localali/.CONTACT:jialu.hu@fu-berlin.de

  abstract: Adeno-associated virus type 2 (AAV) is known to establish latency by preferential
    integration in human chromosome 19q13.42. The AAV non-structural protein Rep appears
    to target a site called AAVS1 by simultaneously binding to Rep-binding sites (RBS)
    present on the AAV genome and within AAVS1. In the absence of Rep, as is the case
    with AAV vectors, chromosomal integration is rare and random. For a genome-wide
    survey of wildtype AAV integration a linker-selection-mediated (LSM)-PCR strategy
    was designed to retrieve AAV-chromosomal junctions. DNA sequence determination
    revealed wildtype AAV integration sites scattered over the entire human genome.
    The bioinformatic analysis of these integration sites compared to those of rep-deficient
    AAV vectors revealed a highly significant overrepresentation of integration events
    near to consensus RBS. Integration hotspots included AAVS1 with 10% of total events.
    Novel hotspots near consensus RBS were identified on chromosome 5p13.3 denoted
    AAVS2 and on chromsome 3p24.3 denoted AAVS3. AAVS2 displayed seven independent
    junctions clustered within only 14 bp of a consensus RBS which proved to bind
    Rep in vitro similar to the RBS in AAVS3. Expression of Rep in the presence of
    rep-deficient AAV vectors shifted targeting preferences from random integration
    back to the neighbourhood of consensus RBS at hotspots and numerous additional
    sites in the human genome. In summary, targeted AAV integration is not as specific
    for AAVS1 as previously assumed. Rather, Rep targets AAV to integrate into open
    chromatin regions in the reach of various, consensus RBS homologues in the human
    genome.

  abstract: Mass spectrometry coupled to high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC-MS)
    is evolving more quickly than ever. A wide range of different instrument types
    and experimental setups are commonly used. Modern instruments acquire huge amounts
    of data, thus requiring tools for an efficient and automated data analysis. Most
    existing software for analyzing HPLC-MS data is monolithic and tailored toward
    a specific application. A more flexible alternative consists of pipeline-based
    tool kits allowing the construction of custom analysis workflows from small building
    blocks, e.g., the Trans Proteomics Pipeline (TPP) or The OpenMS Proteomics Pipeline
    (TOPP). One drawback, however, is the hurdle of setting up complex workflows using
    command line tools. We present TOPPAS, The OpenMS Proteomics Pipeline ASsistant,
    a graphical user interface (GUI) for rapid composition of HPLC-MS analysis workflows.
    Workflow construction reduces to simple drag-and-drop of analysis tools and adding
    connections in between. Integration of external tools into these workflows is
    possible as well. Once workflows have been developed, they can be deployed in
    other workflow management systems or batch processing systems in a fully automated
    fashion. The implementation is portable and has been tested under Windows, Mac
    OS X, and Linux. TOPPAS is open-source software and available free of charge at
    http://www.OpenMS.de/TOPPAS .

  title: Alternate-locus aware variant calling in whole genome sequencing
  status_changed: '2017-01-12 09:36:57'
  abstract: "BackgroundThe last two human genome assemblies have extended
    the previous linear golden-path paradigm of the human genome to a graph-like model
    to better represent regions with a high degree of structural variability. The
    new model offers opportunities to improve the technical validity of variant calling
    in whole-genome sequencing (WGS).MethodsWe developed an algorithm
    that analyzes the patterns of variant calls in the 178 structurally variable regions
    of the GRCh38 genome assembly, and infers whether a given sample is most likely
    to contain sequences from the primary assembly, an alternate locus, or their heterozygous
    combination at each of these 178 regions. We investigate 121 in-house WGS datasets
    that have been aligned to the GRCh37 and GRCh38 assemblies.ResultsWe
    show that stretches of sequences that are largely but not entirely identical between
    the primary assembly and an alternate locus can result in multiple variant calls
    against regions of the primary assembly. In WGS analysis, this results in characteristic
    and recognizable patterns of variant calls at positions that we term alignable
    scaffold-discrepant positions (ASDPs). In 121 in-house genomes, on average 51.8±3.8
    of the 178 regions were found to correspond best to an alternate locus rather
    than the primary assembly sequence, and filtering these genomes with our algorithm
    led to the identification of 7863 variant calls per genome that colocalized with
    ASDPs. Additionally, we found that 437 of 791 genome-wide association study hits
    located within one of the regions corresponded to ASDPs.ConclusionsOur
    algorithm uses the information contained in the 178 structurally variable regions
    of the GRCh38 genome assembly to avoid spurious variant calls in cases where samples
    contain an alternate locus rather than the corresponding segment of the primary
    assembly. These results suggest the great potential of fully incorporating the
    resources of graph-like genome assemblies into variant calling, but also underscore
    the importance of developing computational resources that will allow a full reconstruction
    of the genotype in personal genomes. Our algorithm is freely available at https://github.com/charite/asdpex."

  abstract: "During the course of evolution, an organism’s genome can undergo changes
    that affect the large-scale structure of the genome. These changes include gene
    gain, loss, duplication, chromosome fusion, fission, and rearrangement. When gene
    gain and loss occurs in addition to other types of rearrangement, breakpoints
    of rearrangement can exist that are only detectable by comparison of three or
    more genomes. An arbitrarily large number of these “hidden” breakpoints can exist
    among genomes that exhibit no rearrangements in pairwise comparisons. We
    present an extension of the multichromosomal breakpoint median problem to genomes
    that have undergone gene gain and loss. We then demonstrate that the median distance
    among three genomes can be used to calculate a lower bound on the number of hidden
    breakpoints present. We provide an implementation of this calculation including
    the median distance, along with some practical improvements on the time complexity
    of the underlying algorithm. We apply our approach to measure the abundance
    of hidden breakpoints in simulated data sets under a wide range of evolutionary
    scenarios. We demonstrate that in simulations the hidden breakpoint counts depend
    strongly on relative rates of inversion and gene gain/loss. Finally we apply current
    multiple genome aligners to the simulated genomes, and show that all aligners
    introduce a high degree of error in hidden breakpoint counts, and that this error
    grows with evolutionary distance in the simulation. Our results suggest that hidden
    breakpoint error may be pervasive in genome alignments. "

  abstract: "BackgroundRecent advances in rapid, low-cost sequencing have
    opened up the opportunity to study complete genome sequences. The computational
    approach of multiple genome alignment allows investigation of evolutionarily related
    genomes in an integrated fashion, providing a basis for downstream analyses such
    as rearrangement studies and phylogenetic inference.Graphs have proven
    to be a powerful tool for coping with the complexity of genome-scale sequence
    alignments. The potential of graphs to intuitively represent all aspects of genome
    alignments led to the development of graph-based approaches for genome alignment.
    These approaches construct a graph from a set of local alignments, and derive
    a genome alignment through identification and removal of graph substructures that
    indicate errors in the alignment.ResultsWe compare the structures
    of commonly used graphs in terms of their abilities to represent alignment information.
    We describe how the graphs can be transformed into each other, and identify and
    classify graph substructures common to one or more graphs. Based on previous approaches,
    we compile a list of modifications that remove these substructures.ConclusionWe
    show that crucial pieces of alignment information, associated with inversions
    and duplications, are not visible in the structure of all graphs. If we neglect
    vertex or edge labels, the graphs differ in their information content. Still,
    many ideas are shared among all graph-based approaches. Based on these findings,
    we outline a conceptual framework for graph-based genome alignment that can assist
    in the development of future genome alignment tools. "

  title: 'STELLAR: fast and exact local alignments'
  abstract: "BackgroundLarge-scale comparison of genomic sequences requires reliable
    tools for the search of local alignments. Practical local aligners are in general
    fast, but heuristic, and hence sometimes miss significant matches.ResultsWe
    present here the local pairwise aligner STELLAR that has full sensitivity for
    ε-alignments, i.e. guarantees to report all local alignments of a given minimal
    length and maximal error rate. The aligner is composed of two steps, filtering
    and verification. We apply the SWIFT algorithm for lossless filtering, and have
    developed a new verification strategy that we prove to be exact. Our results on
    simulated and real genomic data confirm and quantify the conjecture that heuristic
    tools like BLAST or BLAT miss a large percentage of significant local alignments.ConclusionsSTELLAR
    is very practical and fast on very long sequences which makes it a suitable new
    tool for finding local alignments between genomic sequences under the edit distance
    model. Binaries are freely available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X at http://www.seqan.de/projects/stellar.

  title: Optimum Search Schemes for Approximate String Matching Using Bidirectional
    FM-Index
  status_changed: '2018-11-12 14:25:35'
  abstract: Finding approximate occurrences of a pattern in a text using a full-text
    index is a central problem in bioinformatics and has been extensively researched.
    Bidirectional indices have opened new possibilities in this regard allowing the
    search to start from anywhere within the pattern and extend in both directions.
    In particular, use of search schemes (partitioning the pattern and searching the
    pieces in certain orders with given bounds on errors) can yield significant speed-ups.
    However, finding optimal search schemes is a difficult combinatorial optimization
    problem. Here for the first time, we propose a mixed integer program (MIP) capable
    to solve this optimization problem for Hamming distance with given number of pieces.
    Our experiments show that the optimal search schemes found by our MIP significantly
    improve the performance of search in bidirectional FM-index upon previous ad-hoc
    solutions. For example, approximate matching of 101-bp Illumina reads (with two
    errors) becomes 35 times faster than standard backtracking. Moreover, despite
    being performed purely in the index, the running time of search using our optimal
    schemes (for up to two errors) is comparable to the best state-of-the-art aligners,
    which benefit from combining search in index with in-text verification using dynamic
    programming. As a result, we anticipate a full-fledged aligner that employs an
    intelligent combination of search in the bidirectional FM-index using our optimal
    search schemes and in-text verification using dynamic programming outperforms
    today's best aligners. The development of such an aligner, called FAMOUS (Fast
    Approximate string Matching using OptimUm search Schemes), is ongoing as our future
    work.

  abstract: "Motivation: Comprehensive identification of structural variations
    (SVs) is a crucial task for studying genetic diversity and diseases. However,
    it remains challenging. There is only a marginal consensus between different methods,
    and our understanding of SVs is substantially limited.In general, integration
    of multiple pieces of evidence including split-read, read-pair, soft-clip, and
    read-depth yields the best result regarding accuracy. However, doing this step
    by step is usually cumbersome and computationally expensive. Result: We
    present Vaquita, an accurate and fast tool for the identification of structural
    variations, which leverages all four types of evidence in a single program. After
    merging SVs from split-reads and discordant read-pairs, Vaquita realigns the soft-clipped
    reads to the selected regions using a fast bit-vector algorithm. Furthermore,
    it also considers the discrepancy of depth distribution around breakpoints using
    Kullback-Leibler divergence. Finally, Vaquita provides an additional metric for
    candidate selection based on voting, and also provides robust prioritization based
    on rank aggregation. We show that Vaquita is robust in terms of sequencing coverage,
    insertion size of the library, and read length, and is comparable or even better
    for the identification of deletions, inversions, duplications, and translocations
    than state-of-the-art tools, using both simulated and real datasets. In addition,
    Vaquita is more than eight times faster than any other tools in comparison. Availability:
    Vaquita is implemented in C++ using the SeqAn library. The source code is
    distributed under the BSD license and can be downloaded at http://github.com/seqan/vaquita"

  title: TOPP - The OpenMS Proteomics Pipeline
  status_changed: '2009-03-11 11:27:12'
  abstract: "Motivation: Experimental techniques in proteomics have seen rapiddevelopment
    over the last few years. Volume and complexity of thedata have both been
    growing at a similar rate. Accordingly, datamanagement and analysis are
    one of the major challenges in proteomics.Flexible algorithms are required
    to handle changing experimentalsetups and to assist in developing and validating
    new methods. Inorder to facilitate these studies, it would be desirable
    to havea flexible `toolbox' of versatile and user-friendly applicationsallowing
    for rapid construction of computational workflows in proteomics.Results:
    We describe a set of tools for proteomics data analysis-- TOPP, The OpenMS
    Proteomics Pipeline. TOPP provides a set of computationaltools which can
    be easily combined into analysis pipelines even bynon-experts and can be
    used in proteomics workflows. These applicationsrange from useful utilities
    (file format conversion, peak picking)over wrapper applications for known
    applications (e.g. Mascot) tocompletely new algorithmic techniques for data
    reduction and dataanalysis. We anticipate that TOPP will greatly facilitate
    rapid prototypingof proteomics data evaluation pipelines. As such, we describe
    thebasic concepts and the current abilities of TOPP and illustrate theseconcepts
    in the context of two example applications: the identificationof peptides
    from a raw data set through database search and the complexanalysis of a
    standard addition experiment for the absolute quantitationof biomarkers.
    The latter example demonstrates TOPP's ability toconstruct flexible analysis
    pipelines in support of complex experimentalsetups. Availability: The TOPP
    components are available as open-sourcesoftware under the lesser GNU public

  abstract: "Motivation: Recombined T and B cell receptor repertoires are increasingly
    being studied using next generation sequencing (NGS) in order to interrogate the
    repertoire composition as well as changes in the distribution of receptor clones

    efficient and unambiguous clonotype assignment to a large number of NGS read sequences,
    including the identification of the incorporated V and J gene segments and the

    data with sophisticated routines for handling errors stemming from PCR and sequencing
    artefacts. The application can handle different kinds of input data originating
    from single- or paired-end sequencing in different configurations and is generic
    regarding the species and gene of interest. We have carefully evaluated our method

  abstract: "High throughput analysis of proteins using mass spectrometry requiresan
    efficient signal preprocessing which reduces the amount of datawith minimal
    loss of information. Therefore the peaks that belongto a peptide have to
    be detected, and important features like theirpeak centroid position, the
    height and the area have to be determined.Here we present a peak picking
    algorithm which detects peaks in anoisy mass spectrum using its continuous
    wavelet transform. By adaptingthe wavelet to the theoretical peak shape,
    each peaks centroid positionis precisely identified; thus, overlapping peaks
    (e.g. caused byelectronspray ionization) are well separated. Representing
    each peaknot only by its centroid position and area but also by the parametersof
    the best fitting asymmetric lorentzian or hyperbolic secant squaredfunctions,
    yields valuable information about the original peak shapefor further analysis.
    Given a mass spectrum with 100,000 raw datapoints representing 200 peaks,
    our algorithm stored 5 parametersper peak, and was able to reduce the memory
    requirement down to 1percent."

  title: "A Geometric Approach for the Alignment of Liquid Chromatography-MassSpectrometry
    Data"
  abstract: "Motivation: Liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS)
    and combined with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) have become a prominent
    tool for the analysis of complex proteomic samples. An important step in a typical
    workflow is the combination of results from multiple LC-MS experiments to improve
    confidence in the obtained measurements or to compare results from different samples.
    To do so, a suitable mapping or alignment between the data sets needs to be estimated.
    The alignment has to correct for variations in mass and elution time which are
    present in all mass spectrometry experiments. Results: We propose a novel
    algorithm to align LC-MS samples and to match corresponding ion species across
    samples. Our algorithm matches landmark signals between two data sets using a
    geometric technique based on pose clustering. Variations in mass and retention
    time are corrected by an affine dewarping function estimated from matched landmarks.
    We use the pairwise dewarping in an algorithm for aligning multiple samples. We
    show that our pose clustering approach is fast and reliable as compared to previous
    approaches. It is robust in the presence of noise and able to accurately align
    samples with only few common ion species. In addition, we can easily handle different
    kinds of LC-MS data and adopt our algorithm to new mass spectrometry technologies.
    Availability: This algorithm is implemented as part of the OpenMS software
    library for shotgun proteomics and available under the Lesser GNU Public License
    (LGPL) at www.openms.de"

  abstract: Many disciplines, from human genetics and oncology to plant breeding,
    microbiology and virology, commonly face the challenge of analyzing rapidly increasing
    numbers of genomes. In case of Homo sapiens, the number of sequenced genomes will
    approach hundreds of thousands in the next few years. Simply scaling up established
    bioinformatics pipelines will not be sufficient for leveraging the full potential
    of such rich genomic data sets. Instead, novel, qualitatively different computational
    methods and paradigms are needed. We will witness the rapid extension of computational
    pan-genomics, a new sub-area of research in computational biology. In this article,
    we generalize existing definitions and understand a pan-genome as any collection
    of genomic sequences to be analyzed jointly or to be used as a reference. We examine
    already available approaches to construct and use pan-genomes, discuss the potential
    benefits of future technologies and methodologies and review open challenges from
    the vantage point of the above-mentioned biological disciplines. As a prominent
    example for a computational paradigm shift, we particularly highlight the transition
    from the representation of reference genomes as strings to representations as
    graphs. We outline how this and other challenges from different application domains
    translate into common computational problems, point out relevant bioinformatics
    techniques and identify open problems in computer science. With this review, we
    aim to increase awareness that a joint approach to computational pan-genomics
    can help address many of the problems currently faced in various domains.

  abstract: Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) data have begun to appear in many applications
    that are clinically relevant, such as resequencing of cancer patients, disease-gene
    discovery and diagnostics for rare diseases, microbiome analyses, and gene expression
    profiling. The analysis of sequencing data is demanding because of the enormous
    data volume and the need for fast turnaround time, accuracy, reproducibility,
    and data security. This Dagstuhl Seminar aimed at a free and deep exchange of
    ideas and needs between the communities of algorithmicists and theoreticians and
    practitioners from the biomedical field. It identified several relevant fields
    such as data structures and algorithms for large data sets, hardware acceleration,
    new problems in the upcoming age of genomes, etc. which were discussed in breakout
    groups.

  abstract: The high degree of similarity between the mouse and human genomes is demonstrated
    through analysis of the sequence of mouse chromosome 16 (Mmu 16), which was obtained
    as part of a whole-genome shotgun assembly of the mouse genome. The mouse genome
    is about 10% smaller than the human genome, owing to a lower repetitive DNA content.
    Comparison of the structure and protein-coding potential of Mmu 16 with that of
    the homologous segments of the human genome identifies regions of conserved synteny
    with human chromosomes (Hsa) 3, 8, 12, 16, 21, and 22. Gene content and order
    are highly conserved between Mmu 16 and the syntenic blocks of the human genome.
    Of the 731 predicted genes on Mmu 16, 509 align with orthologs on the corre- sponding
    portions of the human genome, 44 are likely paralogous to these genes, and 164
    genes have homologs elsewhere in the human genome; there are 14 genes for which
    we could find no human counterpart.

  title: Tools for Label-free Peptide Quantification
  abstract: The increasing scale and complexity of quantitative proteomics studies
    complicate subsequent analysis of the acquired data. Untargeted label-free quantification,
    based either on feature intensities or on spectral counting, is a method that
    scales particularly well with respect to the number of samples. It is thus an
    excellent alternative to labeling techniques. In order to profit from this scalability,
    however, data analysis has to cope with large amounts of data, process them automatically,
    and do a thorough statistical analysis in order to achieve reliable results. We
    review the state of the art with respect to computational tools for label-free
    quantification in untargeted proteomics. The two fundamental approaches are feature-based
    quantification, relying on the summed-up mass spectrometric intensity of peptides,
    and spectral counting, which relies on the number of MS/MS spectra acquired for
    a certain protein. We review the current algorithmic approaches underlying some
    widely used software packages and briefly discuss the statistical strategies for
    analyzing the data.

  abstract: Rapid and efficient quality control according to the public authority
    regulations is mandatory to guarantee safety of the pharmaceuticals and to save
    resources in the pharmaceutical industry. In the case of so-called "grandfather
    products" like the synthetic thyroid hormone thyroxine, strict regulations enforce
    a detailed chemical analysis in order to characterize potentially toxic or pharmacologically
    relevant impurities. We report a straightforward workflow for the comprehensive
    impurity profiling of synthetic thyroid hormones and impurities employing ultrahigh-performance
    liquid chromatography (UHPLC) hyphenated to high-resolution mass spectrometry
    (HRMS). Five different batches of synthetic thyroxin were analyzed resulting in
    the detection of 71 impurities within 3 min total analysis time. Structural elucidation
    of the compounds was accomplished via a combination of accurate mass measurements,
    computer based calculations of molecular formulas, multistage high-resolution
    mass spectrometry (HRMS(n)), and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, which
    enabled the identification of 71 impurities, of which 47 have been unknown so
    far. Thirty of the latter were structurally elucidated, including products of
    deiodination, aliphatic chain oxidation, as well as dimeric compounds as new class
    of thyroid hormone derivatives. Limits of detection for the thyroid compounds
    were in the 6 ng/mL range for negative electrospray ionization mass spectrometric
    detection in full scan mode. Within day and day-to-day repeatabilities of retention
    times and peak areas were below 0.5% and 3.5% R.SD. The performance characteristics
    of the method in terms of robustness and information content clearly show that
    UHPLC-HRMS is adequate for the rapid and reliable detection, identification, and
    semiquantitative determination of trace levels of impurities in synthetic pharmaceuticals.

    and widely used drug for the treatment of hypothyroidism. The therapy is usually
    based on substitution of the natural hormone by a long-term treatment with synthetic
    levothyroxine [1]. It is a narrow therapeutic index drug, for which individual
    dosage levels of patients need to be established over several weeks. Consequently,
    products differing in content of levothyroxine due to compound instability or
    problems in formu- lation can lead to wrong medication and potentially cause severe
    health problems [2,3].∗ Corresponding author. Tel.:+43 0 662 8044 5704; fax:

    2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.abstractLevothyroxine as active
    pharmaceutical ingredient of formulations used for the treatment of hypothy- roidism
    is distributed worldwide and taken by millions of people. An important issue in
    terms of compound stability is its capability to react with ambient oxygen, especially
    in case of long term com- pound storage at elevated temperature. In this study
    we demonstrate that ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography coupled to UV
    spectrometry and high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-UV-HRMS) represent very
    useful approaches to investigate the influence of ambient oxygen on the degradation
    kinet- ics of levothyroxine in the solid state at enhanced degradation conditions.
    Moreover, the impurity pattern of oxidative degradation of levothyroxine is elucidated
    and classified with respect to degradation kinetics at different oxygen levels.
    Kinetic analysis of thyroxine bulk material at 100 ◦ C reveals bi-phasic degra-
    dation kinetics with a distinct change in degradation phases dependent on the
    availability of oxygen. The results clearly show that contact of the bulk material
    to ambient oxygen is a key factor for fast compound degradation. Furthermore,
    the combination of time-resolved HRMS data and automated data processing is shown
    to allow insights into the kinetics and mechanism of impurity formation on individual
    com- pound basis. By comparing degradation profiles, four main classes of profiles
    linked to reaction pathways of thyroxine degradation were identifiable. Finally,
    we show the capability of automated data process- ing for the matching of different
    stressing conditions, in order to extract information about mechanistic similarities.
    As a result, degradation kinetics is influenced by factors like availability of
    oxygen, stressing time, or stressing temperature, while the degradation mechanisms
    appear to be conserved."

  title: 'Investigation of Reaction Mechanisms of Drug Degradation in the Solid State:
    A Kinetic Study Implementing Ultrahigh-Performance Liquid Chromatography and High-Resolution
    Mass Spectrometry for Thermally Stressed Thyroxine'
  status_changed: '2014-03-18 15:10:11'
  abstract: A reaction scheme was derived for the thermal degradation of thyroxine
    in the solid state, using data obtained from ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography
    and high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS). To study the reaction mechanism
    and kinetics of the thermal degradation of the pharmaceutical in the solid state,
    a workflow was developed by generating compound-specific, time-dependent degradation
    or formation curves of at least 13 different degradation products. Such curves
    allowed one to distinguish between first- and second-generation degradation products,
    as well as impurities resulting from chemical synthesis. The structures of the
    degradation products were derived from accurate molecular masses and multistage
    mass spectrometry. Deiodination and oxidative side chain degradation were found
    to be the major degradation reactions, resulting in the formation of deiodinated
    thyroxines, as well as acetic acid, benzoic acid, formaldehyde, acetamide, hydroxyacetic
    acid, oxoacetic acid, hydroxyacetamide, or oxoacetamide derivatives of thyroxine
    or deiodinated thyroxine. Upon additional structural verification of mass spectrometric
    data using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, this comprehensive body of
    data sheds light on an elaborate, radical-driven reaction scheme, explaining the
    presence or formation of impurities in thermally stressed thyroxine.

  abstract: "BackgroundIn recent years, several mass spectrometry-based omics
    technologies emerged to investigate qualitative and quantitative changes within
    thousands of biologically active components such as proteins, lipids and metabolites.
    The research enabled through these methods potentially contributes to the diagnosis
    and pathophysiology of human diseases as well as to the clarification of structures
    and interactions between biomolecules. Simultaneously, technological advances
    in the field of mass spectrometry leading to an ever increasing amount of data,
    demand high standards in efficiency, accuracy and reproducibility of potential
    analysis software.ResultsThis article presents the current state
    and ongoing developments in OpenMS, a versatile open-source framework aimed at
    enabling reproducible analyses of high-throughput mass spectrometry data. It provides
    implementations of frequently occurring processing operations on MS data through
    a clean application programming interface in C++ and Python. A collection of 185
    tools and ready-made workflows for typical MS-based experiments enable convenient
    analyses for non-developers and facilitate reproducible research without losing
    flexibility.ConclusionsOpenMS will continue to increase its ease
    of use for developers as well as users with improved continuous integration/deployment
    strategies, regular trainings with updated training materials and multiple sources
    of support. The active developer community ensures the incorporation of new features
    to support state of the art research."

  abstract: Accurate protein inference in the presence of shared peptides is still
    one of the key problems in bottom-up proteomics. Most protein inference tools
    employing simple heuristic inference strategies are efficient but exhibit reduced
    accuracy. More advanced probabilistic methods often exhibit better inference quality
    but tend to be too slow for large data sets. Here, we present a novel protein
    inference method, EPIFANY, combining a loopy belief propagation algorithm with
    convolution trees for efficient processing of Bayesian networks. We demonstrate
    that EPIFANY combines the reliable protein inference of Bayesian methods with
    significantly shorter runtimes. On the 2016 iPRG protein inference benchmark data,
    EPIFANY is the only tested method that finds all true-positive proteins at a 5%
    protein false discovery rate (FDR) without strict prefiltering on the peptide-spectrum
    match (PSM) level, yielding an increase in identification performance (+10% in
    the number of true positives and +14% in partial AUC) compared to previous approaches.
    Even very large data sets with hundreds of thousands of spectra (which are intractable
    with other Bayesian and some non-Bayesian tools) can be processed with EPIFANY
    within minutes. The increased inference quality including shared peptides results
    in better protein inference results and thus increased robustness of the biological
    hypotheses generated. EPIFANY is available as open-source software for all major
    platforms at https://OpenMS.de/epifany.

  title: 'EPR-Dictionaries: A Practical and Fast Data Structure for Constant Time
    Searches in Unidirectional and Bidirectional FM Indices'
  abstract: "The unidirectional FM index was introduced by Ferragina and Manzini in
    2000 and allows to search a pattern in the index in one direction. The bidirectional
    FM index (2FM) was introduced by Lam et al. in 2009. It allows to search for a
    pattern by extending an infix of the pattern arbitrarily to the left or right.
    If σ is the size of the alphabet then the method of Lam et al. can conduct one
    step in time O(σ) while needing space O(σ⋅n) using constant time rank queries
    on bit vectors. Schnattinger and colleagues improved this time to O(logσ) while
    using O(logσ⋅n) bits of space for both, the FM and 2FM index. This is achieved
    by the use of binary wavelet trees.In this paper we introduce a new, practical
    method for conducting an exact search in a uni- and bidirectional FM index in
    O(1) time per step while using O(logσ⋅n)+o(logσ⋅σ⋅n) bits of space. This is
    done by replacing the binary wavelet tree by a new data structure, the Enhanced
    Prefixsum Rank dictionary (EPR-dictionary).We implemented this method
    in the SeqAn C++ library and experimentally validated our theoretical results.
    In addition we compared our implementation with other freely available implementations
    of bidirectional indices and show that we are between ≈2.2−4.2 times faster. This
    will have a large impact for many bioinformatics applications that rely on practical
    implementations of (2)FM indices e.g. for read mapping. To our knowledge this
    is the first implementation of a constant time method for a search step in 2FM
    indices."

  abstract: "Motivation: Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has revolutionized biomedical
    research in the past decade and led to a continuous stream of developments in
    bioinformatics, addressing the need for fast and space-efficient solutions for
    analyzing NGS data. Often researchers need to analyze a set of genomic sequences
    that stem from closely related species or are indeed individuals of the same species.
    Hence, the analyzed sequences are similar. For analyses where local changes in
    the examined sequence induce only local changes in the results, it is obviously
    desirable to examine identical or similar regions not repeatedly.Results:
    In this work, we provide a datatype that exploits data parallelism inherent in
    a set of similar sequences by analyzing shared regions only once. In real-world
    experiments, we show that algorithms that otherwise would scan each reference
    sequentially can be speeded up by a factor of 115.Availability: The data
    structure and associated tools are publicly available at http://www.seqan.de/projects/jst

  title: Generic accelerated sequence alignment in SeqAn using vectorization and multi-threading
  abstract: "MotivationPairwise sequence alignment is undoubtedly a central
    tool in many bioinformatics analyses. In this paper, we present a generically
    accelerated module for pairwise sequence lignments applicable for a broad range
    of applications. In our module, we unified the standard dynamic programming kernel
    used for pairwise sequence alignments and extended it with a generalized inter-sequence
    vectorization layout, such that many alignments can be computed simultaneously
    by exploiting SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data) instructions of modern processors.
    We then extended the module by adding two layers of thread-level parallelization,
    where we a) distribute many independent alignments on multiple threads and b)
    inherently parallelize a single alignment computation using a work stealing approach
    producing a dynamic wavefront progressing along the minor diagonal.ResultsWe
    evaluated our alignment vectorization and parallelization on different processors,
    including the newest Intel® Xeon® (Skylake) and Intel® Xeon Phi™ (KNL) processors,
    and use cases. The instruction set AVX512-BW (Byte and Word), available on Skylake
    processors, can genuinely improve the performance of vectorized alignments. We
    could run single alignments 1600 times faster on the Xeon Phi™ and 1400 times
    faster on the Xeon® than executing them with our previous sequential alignment
    module.AvailabilityThe module is programmed in C++ using the SeqAn
    (Reinert et al., 2017) library and distributed with version 2.4. under the BSD
    license. We support SSE4, AVX2, AVX512 instructions and included UME::SIMD, a
    SIMD-instruction wrapper library, to extend our module for further instruction
    sets. We thoroughly test all alignment components with all major C++ compilers
    on various platforms."

  abstract: Abstract Multiple sequence alignment as a means of comparing DNA, RNA
    or amino acid sequences is an essential precondition for various analyses, including
    structure prediction, modeling binding sites, phylogeny or function prediction.
    This range of applications implies a demand for versatile, flexible and specialized
    meth- ods to compute accurate alignments. This chapter summarizes the key algorithmic
    insights gained in the past years to facilitate both, an easy understanding of
    the current multiple sequence alignment literature and to enable the readers to
    use and apply current tools in their own everyday research.

  abstract: "This paper describes a novel algorithm to analyze genetic linkagedata
    using pattern recognition techniques and genetic algorithms(GA). The method
    allows a search for regions of the chromosome thatmay contain genetic variations
    that jointly predispose individualsfor a particular disease. The method uses
    correlation analysis, filteringtheory and genetic algorithms to achieve this
    goal. Because currentgenome scans use from hundreds to hundreds of thousands
    of markers,two versions of the method have been implemented. The first is
    anexhaustive analysis version that can be used to visualize, explore,and
    analyze small genetic data sets for two marker correlations;the second is
    a GA version, which uses a parallel implementationallowing searches of higher-order
    correlations in large data sets.Results on simulated data sets indicate that
    the method can be informativein the identification of major disease loci and
    geneâ\x80\x93gene interactionsin genome-wide linkage data and that further
    exploration of thesetechniques is justified. The results presented for both
    variantsof the method show that it can help genetic epidemiologists to identifypromising
    combinations of genetic factors that might predispose tocomplex disorders.
    In particular, the correlation analysis of IBDexpression patterns might hint
    to possible geneâ\x80\x93gene interactionsand the filtering might be a fruitful
    approach to distinguish truecorrelation signals from noise."

- title: Segment-based multiple sequence alignment
  status_changed: '2009-03-11 11:27:21'
  abstract: "Motivation: Many multiple sequence alignment tools have been developedin
    the past, progressing either in speed or alignment accuracy. Giventhe importance
    and wide-spread use of alignment tools, progress inboth categories is a
    contribution to the community and has drivenresearch in the field so far.
    Results: We introduce a graph-basedextension to the consistency-based, progressive
    alignment strategy.We apply the consistency notion to segments instead of
    single characters.The main problem we solve in this context is to define
    segments ofthe sequences in such a way that a graph-based alignment is possible.We
    implemented the algorithm using the SeqAn library and report resultson amino
    acid and DNA sequences. The benefit of our approach is threefold:(1) sequences
    with conserved blocks can be rapidly aligned, (2) theimplementation is conceptually
    easy, generic and fast and (3) theconsistency idea can be extended to align
    multiple genomic sequences.Availability: The segment-based multiple sequence
    alignment toolcan be downloaded from http://www.seqan.de/projects/msa.html.
    A novelversion of T-Coffee interfaced with the tool is available from http://www.tcoffee.org.The
    usage of the tool is described in both documentations. Contact:rausch@inf.fu-berlin.de"

  abstract: 'Motivation: Novel high-throughput sequencing technologies pose new algorithmic
    challenges in handling massive amounts of short- read, high-coverage data. A robust
    and versatile consensus tool is of particular interest for such data since a sound
    multi-read alignment is a prerequisite for variation analyses, accurate genome
    assemblies and insert sequencing. Results: A multi-read alignment algorithm for
    de novo or reference- guided genome assembly is presented. The program identifies
    segments shared by multiple reads and then aligns these segments using a consistency-enhanced
    alignment graph. On real de novo sequencing data obtained from the newly established
    NCBI Short Read Archive, the program performs similarly in quality to other comparable
    programs. On more challenging simulated datasets for insert sequencing and variation
    analyses, our program outperforms the other tools. Availability: The consensus
    program can be downloaded from http://www.seqan.de/projects/consensus.html. It
    can be used stand- alone or in conjunction with the Celera Assembler. Both application
    scenarios as well as the usage of the tool are described in the documentation.

  title: Alignment of Next-Generation Sequencing Reads
  status_changed: '2016-02-25 13:11:02'
  abstract: "High-throughput DNA sequencing has considerably changed the possibilities
    for conducting biomedical research by measuring billions of short DNA or RNA fragments.
    A central computational problem, and for many applications a first step, consists
    of determining where the fragments came fromin the original genome. In this
    article, we review the main techniques for generating the fragments, the main
    applications, and the main algorithmic ideas for computing a solution to the read
    alignment problem. In addition, we describe pitfalls and difficulties connected
    to determining the correct positions of reads."

  abstract: "BackgroundThe use of novel algorithmic techniques is pivotal
    to many important problems in life science. For example the sequencing of the
    human genome (Venter et al., 2001) would not have been possible without advanced
    assembly algorithms and the development of practical BWT based read mappers have
    been instrumental for NGS analysis. However, owing to the high speed of technological
    progress and the urgent need for bioinformatics tools, there was a widening gap
    between state-of-the-art algorithmic techniques and the actual algorithmic components
    of tools that are in widespread use. We previously addressed this by introducing
    the SeqAn library of efficient data types and algorithms in 2008 (Döring et al.,
    2008).ResultsThe SeqAn library has matured considerably since
    its first publication 9 years ago. In this article we review its status as an
    established resource for programmers in the field of sequence analysis and its
    contributions to many analysis tools.ConclusionsWe anticipate
    that SeqAn will continue to be a valuable resource, especially since it started
    to actively support various hardware acceleration techniques in a systematic manner.KeywordsNGS

  title: Flexbar 3.0 – SIMD and multicore parallelization
  abstract: "Motivation: High-throughput sequencing machines can process many
    samples in a single run. For Illumina systems, sequencing reads are barcoded with
    an additional DNA tag that is contained in the respective sequencing adapters.
    The recognition of barcode and adapter sequences is hence commonly needed for
    the analysis of next-generation sequencing data. Flexbar performs demultiplexing
    based on barcodes and adapter trimming for such data. The massive amounts of data
    generated on modern sequencing machines demand that this preprocessing is done
    as efficiently as possible.Results: We present Flexbar 3.0, the successor
    of the popular program Flexbar. It employs now twofold parallelism: multi-threading
    and additionally SIMD vectorization. Both types of parallelism are used to speed-up
    the computation of pair-wise sequence alignments, which are used for the detection
    of barcodes and adapters. Furthermore, new features were included to cover a wide
    range of applications. We evaluated the performance of Flexbar based on a simulated
    sequencing dataset. Our program outcompetes other tools in terms of speed and
    is among the best tools in the presented quality benchmark.Availability

  abstract: High-resolution mass spectrometry (MS) has become an important tool in
    the life sciences, contributing to the diagnosis and understanding of human diseases,
    elucidating biomolecular structural information and characterizing cellular signaling
    networks. However, the rapid growth in the volume and complexity of MS data makes
    transparent, accurate and reproducible analysis difficult. We present OpenMS 2.0
    (http://www.openms.de), a robust, open-source, cross-platform software specifically
    designed for the flexible and reproducible analysis of high-throughput MS data.
    The extensible OpenMS software implements common mass spectrometric data processing
    tasks through a well-defined application programming interface in C++ and Python
    and through standardized open data formats. OpenMS additionally provides a set
    of 185 tools and ready-made workflows for common mass spectrometric data processing
    tasks, which enable users to perform complex quantitative mass spectrometric analyses
    with ease.

  abstract: "The present study was performed in an attempt to develop an in vitro
    integrated testing strategy (ITS) to evaluate drug-induced neurotoxicity. A number
    of endpoints were analyzed using two complementary brain cell culture models and
    an in vitro blood–brain barrier (BBB) model after single and repeated exposure
    treatments with selected drugs that covered the major biological, pharmacological
    and neuro-toxicological responses. Furthermore, four drugs (diazepam, cyclosporine
    A, chlorpromazine and amiodarone) were tested more in depth as representatives
    of different classes of neurotoxicants, inducing toxicity through different pathways
    of toxicity.The developed in vitro BBB model allowed detection of toxic
    effects at the level of BBB and evaluation of drug transport through the barrier
    for predicting free brain concentrations of the studied drugs. The measurement
    of neuronal electrical activity was found to be a sensitive tool to predict the
    neuroactivity and neurotoxicity of drugs after acute exposure. The histotypic
    3D re-aggregating brain cell cultures, containing all brain cell types, were found
    to be well suited for OMICs analyses after both acute and long term treatment.The
    obtained data suggest that an in vitro ITS based on the information obtained from
    BBB studies and combined with metabolomics, proteomics and neuronal electrical
    activity measurements performed in stable in vitro neuronal cell culture systems,
    has high potential to improve current in vitro drug-induced neurotoxicity evaluation.Abbreviations:BBB,

  title: Fast and Adaptive Variable Order Markov Chain Construction
  status_changed: '2009-03-11 11:27:27'
  abstract: " Variable order Markov chains (VOMCs) are a flexible class of modelsthat
    extend the well-known Markov chains. They have been appliedto a variety
    of problems in computational biology, e.g. protein familyclassification.
    A linear time and space construction algorithm hasbeen published in 2000
    by Apostolico and Bejerano. However, neithera report of the actual running
    time nor an implementation of it haveever been published since. Using their
    theoretical results, we implementgeneral and problem oriented algorithms
    considering recent advancesin string matching. We introduce a new software
    which is orders ofmagnitudes faster than current tools for building VOMCs,
    and is suitablefor large scale analysis. Along the way we show that the
    lazy suffixtree algorithm by Giegerich and others can compete with state-of-the-artsuffix
    array methods in terms of time and space under the type ofconstraints we
    have analyzed in this work. "

  title: 'Fiona: a parallel and automatic strategy for read error correction'
  abstract: 'Motivation: Automatic error correction of high-throughput sequencing
    data can have a dramatic impact on the amount of usable base pairs and their quality.
    It has been shown that the performance of tasks such as de novo genome assembly
    and SNP calling can be dramatically improved after read error correction. While
    a large number of methods specialized for correcting substitution errors as found
    in Illumina data exist, few methods for the correction of indel errors, common
    to technologies like 454 or Ion Torrent, have been proposed.Results: We present
    Fiona, a new stand-alone read errorâ��correction method. Fiona provides a new
    statistical approach for sequencing error detection and optimal error correction
    and estimates its parameters automatically. Fiona is able to correct substitution,
    insertion and deletion errors and can be applied to any sequencing technology.
    It uses an efficient implementation of the partial suffix array to detect read
    overlaps with different seed lengths in parallel. We tested Fiona on several real
    datasets from a variety of organisms with different read lengths and compared
    its performance with state-of-the-art methods. Fiona shows a constantly higher
    correction accuracy over a broad range of datasets from 454 and Ion Torrent sequencers,
    without compromise in speed.Conclusion: Fiona is an accurate parameter-free read
    errorâ��correction method that can be run on inexpensive hardware and can make
    use of multicore parallelization whenever available. Fiona was implemented using
    the SeqAn library for sequence analysis and is publicly available for download

  abstract: "Liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS) has becomea
    major tool for the study of biological processes. High-throughputLC-MS experimentsare
    frequently conducted in modern laboratories,generating an enormous amountof
    data per day. A manual inspectionis therefore no longer a feasible task.
    Consequently, there is aneed for computational tools that can rapidly provide
    informationaboutmass, elution time, and abundance of the compounds in a
    LC-MS sample.Wepresent an algorithm for the detection and quantification
    of peptidesin LC-MS data. Our approach is flexible and independent of the
    MStechnology in use. It is basedon a combination of the sweep lineparadigm
    with a novel wavelet function tailoredto detect isotopicpatterns of peptides.
    We propose a simple voting schema to usetheredundant information in consecutive
    scans for an accurate determinationofmonoisotopic masses and charge states.
    By explicitly modeling theinstrument inaccuracy, we are also able to cope
    with data sets ofdifferent quality and resolution.We evaluate our technique
    on datafrom different instruments and show that we canrapidly estimate mass,centroid
    of retention time and abundance of peptides in a sound algorithmicframework.
    Finally, we compare the performance of our method to severalother techniques
    on three data sets of varying complexity."

  abstract: "BACKGROUND: Mass Spectrometry coupled to Liquid Chromatography (LC-MS)is
    commonly used to analyze the protein content of biological samplesin large
    scale studies. The data resulting from an LC-MS experimentis huge, highly
    complex and noisy. Accordingly, it has sparked newdevelopments in Bioinformatics,
    especially in the fields of algorithmdevelopment, statistics and software
    engineering. In a quantitativelabel-free mass spectrometry experiment, crucial
    steps are the detectionof peptide features in the mass spectra and the alignment
    of samplesby correcting for shifts in retention time. At the moment, it
    isdifficult to compare the plethora of algorithms for these tasks.So
    far, curated benchmark data exists only for peptide identificationalgorithms
    but no data that represents a ground truth for the evaluationof feature
    detection, alignment and filtering algorithms. RESULTS:We present LC-MSsim,
    a simulation software for LC-ESI-MS experiments.It simulates ESI spectra
    on the MS level. It reads a list of proteinsfrom a FASTA file and digests
    the protein mixture using a user-definedenzyme. The software creates an
    LC-MS data set using a predictorfor the retention time of the peptides and
    a model for peak shapesand elution profiles of the mass spectral peaks.
    Our software alsooffers the possibility to add contaminants, to change the
    backgroundnoise level and includes a model for the detectability of peptidesin
    mass spectra. After the simulation, LC-MSsim writes the simulateddata to
    public XML formats (mzXML or mzData). The software also storesthe positions
    (monoisotopic m/z and retention time) and ion countsof the simulated ions
    in separate files. CONCLUSIONS: LC-MSsim generatessimulated LC-MS data sets
    and incorporates models for peak shapesand contaminations. Algorithm developers
    can match the results offeature detection and alignment algorithms against
    the simulatedion lists and meaningful error rates can be computed. We anticipatethat
    LC-MSsim will be useful to the wider community to perform benchmarkstudies
    and comparisons between computational tools."

  title: 'Where did you come from, where did you go: Refining metagenomic analysis
    tools for horizontal gene transfer characterisation'
  abstract: "Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) has changed the way we regard evolution.
    Instead of waiting for the next generation to establish new traits, especially
    bacteria are able to take a shortcut via HGT that enables them to pass on genes
    from one individual to another, even across species boundaries. The tool Daisy
    offers the first HGT detection approach based on read mapping that provides complementary
    evidence compared to existing methods. However, Daisy relies on the acceptor and
    donor organism involved in the HGT being known. We introduce DaisyGPS, a mapping-based
    pipeline that is able to identify acceptor and donor reference candidates of an
    HGT event based on sequencing reads. Acceptor and donor identification is akin
    to species identification in metagenomic samples based on sequencing reads, a
    problem addressed by metagenomic profiling tools. However, acceptor and donor
    references have certain properties such that these methods cannot be directly
    applied. DaisyGPS uses MicrobeGPS, a metagenomic profiling tool tailored towards
    estimating the genomic distance between organisms in the sample and the reference
    database. We enhance the underlying scoring system of MicrobeGPS to account for
    the sequence patterns in terms of mapping coverage of an acceptor and donor involved
    in an HGT event, and report a ranked list of reference candidates. These candidates
    can then be further evaluated by tools like Daisy to establish HGT regions. We
    successfully validated our approach on both simulated and real data, and show
    its benefits in an investigation of an outbreak involving Methicillin-resistant
    Staphylococcus aureus data.Author summaryEvolution is traditionally
    viewed as a process where changes are only vertically inherited from parent to
    offspring across generations. Many principles such as phylogenetic trees and even
    the “tree of life” are based on that doctrine. The concept of horizontal gene
    transfer changed the way we regard evolution completely. Horizontal gene transfer
    is the movement of genetic information between distantly related organisms of
    the same generation. Genome sequencing not only provided further evidence complementing
    experimental evidence but also shed light onto the frequency and prominence of
    this concept. Especially the rapid spread of antimicrobial resistance genes is
    a prominent example for the impact that horizontal gene transfer can have for
    public health. Next generation sequencing brought means for quick and relatively
    cheap analysis of even complex metagenomic samples where horizontal gene transfer
    is bound to happen frequently. Methods to directly detect and characterise horizontal
    gene transfer from such sequencing data, however, are still lacking. We here provide
    a method to identify organisms potentially involved in horizontal gene transfer
    events to be used in downstream analysis that enables a characterisation of a
    horizontal gene transfer event in terms of impact and prevalence."

  title: Fast and accurate read mapping with approximate seeds and multiple backtracking
  abstract: We present Masai, a read mapper representing the state-of-the-art in terms
    of speed and accuracy. Our tool is an order of magnitude faster than RazerS 3
    and mrFAST, 2–4 times faster and more accurate than Bowtie 2 and BWA. The novelties
    of our read mapper are filtration with approximate seeds and a method for multiple
    backtracking. Approximate seeds, compared with exact seeds, increase filtration
    specificity while preserving sensitivity. Multiple backtracking amortizes the
    cost of searching a large set of seeds by taking advantage of the repetitiveness
    of next-generation sequencing data. Combined together, these two methods significantly
    speed up approximate search on genomic data sets. Masai is implemented in C++
    using the SeqAn library. The source code is distributed under the BSD license
    and binaries for Linux, Mac OS X and Windows can be freely downloaded from http://www.seqan.de/projects/masai.

  abstract: We present in this paper scalable algorithms for optimal string similarity
    search and join. Our methods are variations of those applied in Masai [15], our
    recently published tool for mapping high-throughput DNA sequencing data with unpreceded

    seeds and methods for multiple backtracking. Approximate seeds, compared to exact
    seeds, increase filtration specificity while preserving sensitivity. Multiple
    backtracking amortizes the cost of searching a large set of seeds. Combined together,
    these two methods significantly speed up string similarity search and join operations.

  title: Assessment of transcript reconstruction methods for RNA-seq
  contact_email: david.weese@fu-berlin.de
  abstract: We evaluated 25 protocol variants of 14 independent computational methods
    for exon identification, transcript reconstruction and expression-level quantification
    from RNA-seq data. Our results show that most algorithms are able to identify
    discrete transcript components with high success rates but that assembly of complete
    isoform structures poses a major challenge even when all constituent elements
    are identified. Expression-level estimates also varied widely across methods,
    even when based on similar transcript models. Consequently, the complexity of
    higher eukaryotic genomes imposes severe limitations on transcript recall and
    splice product discrimination that are likely to remain limiting factors for the
    analysis of current-generation RNA-seq data.

  title: OpenMS - An open-source software framework for mass spectrometry
  abstract: "BACKGROUND: Mass spectrometry is an essential analytical techniquefor
    high-throughput analysis in proteomics and metabolomics. Thedevelopment
    of new separation techniques, precise mass analyzersand experimental protocols
    is a very active field of research. Thisleads to more complex experimental
    setups yielding ever increasingamounts of data. Consequently, analysis of
    the data is currentlyoften the bottleneck for experimental studies. Although
    softwaretools for many data analysis tasks are available today, they areoften
    hard to combine with each other or not flexible enough to allowfor rapid
    prototyping of a new analysis workflow. RESULTS: We presentOpenMS, a software
    framework for rapid application development inmass spectrometry. OpenMS
    has been designed to be portable, easy-to-useand robust while offering a
    rich functionality ranging from basicdata structures to sophisticated algorithms
    for data analysis. Thishas already been demonstrated in several studies.

  abstract: "MOTIVATION:The landscape of structural variation (SV) including complex
    duplication and translocation patterns is far from resolved. SV detection tools
    usually exhibit low agreement, are often geared toward certain types or size ranges
    of variation and struggle to correctly classify the type and exact size of SVs.RESULTS:We
    present Gustaf (Generic mUlti-SpliT Alignment Finder), a sound generic multi-split
    SV detection tool that detects and classifies deletions, inversions, dispersed
    duplications and translocations of <span class='mathrm'>ge</span>30 bp. Our approach
    is based on a generic multi-split alignment strategy that can identify SV breakpoints
    with base pair resolution. We show that Gustaf correctly identifies SVs, especially
    in the range from 30 to 100 bp, which we call the next-generation sequencing (NGS)
    twilight zone of SVs, as well as larger SVs &gt;500 bp. Gustaf performs better
    than similar tools in our benchmark and is furthermore able to correctly identify
    size and location of dispersed duplications and translocations, which otherwise
    might be wrongly classified, for example, as large deletions. Availability and
    implementation: Project information, paper benchmark and source code are available

  title: Development and optimisation of a generic micro LC-ESI-MS method for the
    qualitative and quantitative determination of 30-mer toxic gliadin peptides in
    wheat flour for food analysis
  abstract: We sometimes see manufactured bakery products on the market which are
    labelled as being gluten free. Why is the content of such gluten proteins of importance
    for the fabrication of bakery industry and for the products? The gluten proteins
    represent up to 80 % of wheat proteins, and they are conventionally subdivided
    into gliadins and glutenins. Gliadins belong to the proline and glutamine-rich
    prolamin family. Its role in human gluten intolerance, as a consequence of its
    harmful effects, is well documented in the scientific literature. The only known
    therapy so far is a gluten-free diet, and hence, it is important to develop robust
    and reliable analytical methods to quantitatively assess the presence of the identified
    peptides causing the so-called coeliac disease. This work describes the development
    of a new, fast and robust micro ion pair-LC-MS analytical method for the qualitative
    and quantitative determination of 30-mer toxic gliadin peptides in wheat flour.
    The use of RapiGest™ SF as a denaturation reagent prior to the enzymatic digestion
    showed to shorten the measuring time. During the optimisation of the enzymatic
    digestion step, the best 30-mer toxic peptide was identified from the maximum
    recovery after 3 h of digestion time. The lower limit of quantification was determined
    to be 0.25 ng/μL. The method has shown to be linear for the selected concentration
    range of 0.25–3.0 ng/μL. The uncertainty related to reproducibility of measurement
    procedure, excluding the extraction step, has shown to be 5.0 % (N = 12). Finally,
    this method was successfully applied to the quantification of 30-mer toxic peptides
    from commercial wheat flour with an overall uncertainty under reproducibility
    conditions of 6.4 % including the extraction of the gliadin fraction. The results
    were always expressed as the average of the values from all standard concentrations.
    Subsequently, the final concentration of the 30-mer toxic peptide in the flour
    was calculated and expressed in milligrams per gram unit. The determined, calculated
    concentration of the 30-mer toxic peptide in the flour was found to be 1.29 ± 0.37
    μg/g in flour (N = 25, sy = 545,075, f = 25 − 2 (t = 2.069), P = 95 %, two-sided).

  abstract: A 2.91-billion base pair (bp) consensus sequence of the euchromatic portion
    of the human genome was generated by the whole-genome shotgun sequencing method.
    The 14.8-billion bp DNA sequence was generated over 9 months from 27,271,853 high-quality
    sequence reads (5.11-fold coverage of the genome) from both ends of plasmid clones
    made from the DNA of five individuals. Two assembly strategies—a whole-genome
    assembly and a regional chromosome assembly—were used, each combining sequence
    data from Celera and the publicly funded genome effort. The public data were shredded
    into 550-bp segments to create a 2.9-fold coverage of those genome regions that
    had been sequenced, without including biases inherent in the cloning and assembly
    procedure used by the publicly funded group. This brought the effective cov- erage
    in the assemblies to eightfold, reducing the number and size of gaps in the final
    assembly over what would be obtained with 5.11-fold coverage. The two assembly
    strategies yielded very similar results that largely agree with independent mapping
    data. The assemblies effectively cover the euchromatic regions of the human chromosomes.
    More than 90% of the genome is in scaffold assemblies of 100,000 bp or more, and
    25% of the genome is in scaffolds of 10 million bp or larger. Analysis of the
    genome sequence revealed 26,588 protein-encoding transcripts for which there was
    strong corroborating evidence and an additional

  abstract: "Quality control is increasingly recognized as a crucialaspect of
    mass spectrometry based proteomics. Severalrecent papers discuss relevant
    parameters for qualitycontrol and present applications to extract these from
    theinstrumental raw data. What has been missing, however,is a standard
    data exchange format for reporting theseperformance metrics. We therefore
    developed the qcMLformat, an XML-based standard that follows the designprinciples
    of the related mzML, mzIdentML, mzQuantML,and TraML standards from the HUPO-PSI
    (ProteomicsStandards Initiative). In addition to the XML format, wealso
    provide tools for the calculation of a wide range ofquality metrics as well
    as a database format and interconversion tools, so that existing LIMS systems
    can easily add relational storage of the quality control data to their existing
    schema. We here describe the qcML specification, along with possible use cases
    and an illustrative example of the subsequent analysis possibilities. All information
    about qcML is available at http://code.google.com/p/qcml. Molecular & Cellular

  title: Indices and Applications in High-Throughput Sequencing
  status_changed: '2013-06-15 19:54:07'
  abstract: "Recent advances in sequencing technology allow to produce billions of
    base pairs per day in the form of reads of length 100 bp an longer and current
    developments promise the personal $1,000 genome in a couple of years. The analysis
    of these unprecedented amounts of data demands for efficient data structures and
    algorithms. One such data structures is the substring index, that represents all
    substrings or substrings up to a certain length contained in a given text.In
    this thesis we propose 3 substring indices, which we extend to be applicable to
    millions of sequences. We devise internal and external memory construction algorithms
    and a uniform framework for accessing the generalized suffix tree. Additionally
    we propose different index-based applications, e.g. exact and approximate pattern
    matching and different repeat search algorithms.Second, we present the read
    mapping tool RazerS, which aligns millions of single or paired-end reads of arbitrary
    lengths to their potential genomic origin using either Hamming or edit distance.
    Our tool can work either lossless or with a user-defined loss rate at higher speeds.
    Given the loss rate, we present a novel approach that guarantees not to lose more
    reads than specified. This enables the user to adapt to the problem at hand and
    provides a seamless tradeoff between sensitivity and running time. We compare
    RazerS with other state-of-the-art read mappers and show that it has the highest
    sensitivity and a comparable performance on various real-world datasets.At
    last, we propose a general approach for frequency based string mining, which has
    many applications, e.g. in contrast data mining. Our contribution is a novel and
    lightweight algorithm that is faster and uses less memory than the best available
    algorithms. We show its applicability for mining multiple databases with a variety
    of frequency constraints. As such, we use the notion of entropy from information
    theory to generalize the emerging substring mining problem to multiple databases.
    To demonstrate the improvement of our algorithm we compared to recent approaches
    on real-world experiments of various string domains, e.g. natural language, DNA,
    or protein sequences."

  abstract: Second-generation sequencing technologies deliver DNA sequence data at
    unprecedented high throughput. Common to most biological applications is a mapping
    of the reads to an almost identical or highly similar reference genome. Due to
    the large amounts of data, eﬃcient algorithms and implementations are crucial
    for this task. We present an eﬃcient read mapping tool called RazerS. It allows
    the user to align sequencing reads of arbitrary length using either the Hamming
    distance or the edit distance. Our tool can work either lossless or with a user-deﬁned
    loss rate at higher speeds. Given the loss rate, we present an approach that guarantees
    not to lose more reads than speciﬁed. This enables the user to adapt to the problem
    at hand and provides a seamless tradeoﬀ between sensitivity and running time.

  title: 'RazerS 3: Faster, fully sensitive read mapping'
  abstract: "Motivation: During the last years NGS sequencing has become a key technology
    for many applications in the biomedical sciences. Throughput continues to increase
    and new protocols provide longer reads than currently available. In almost all
    applications, read mapping is a first step. Hence, it is crucial to have algorithms
    and implementations that perform fast, with high sensitivity, and are able to
    deal with long reads and a large absolute number of indels.Results: RazerS
    is a read mapping program with adjustable sensitivity based on counting q-grams.
    In this work we propose the successor RazerS 3 which now supports shared-memory
    parallelism, an additional seed-based filter with adjustable sensitivity, a much
    faster, banded version of the Myers’ bit-vector algorithm for verification, memory
    saving measures and support for the SAM output format. This leads to a much improved
    performance for mapping reads, in particular long reads with many errors. We extensively
    compare RazerS 3 with other popular read mappers and show that its results are
    often superior to them in terms of sensitivity while exhibiting practical and
    often competetive run times. In addition, RazerS 3 works without a precomputed
    index.Availability and Implementation: Source code and binaries are freely
    available for download at http://www.seqan.de/projects/razers. RazerS 3 is implemented
    in C++ and OpenMP under a GPL license using the SeqAn library and supports Linux,
    Mac OS X, and Windows."

  title: Mechanism of cisplatin proximal tubule toxicity revealed by integrating transcriptomics,
    proteomics, metabolomics and biokinetics
  abstract: Cisplatin is one of the most widely used chemotherapeutic agents for the
    treatment of solid tumours. The major dose-limiting factor is nephrotoxicity,
    in particular in the proximal tubule. Here, we use an integrated omics approach,
    including transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics coupled to biokinetics
    to identify cell stress response pathways induced by cisplatin. The human renal
    proximal tubular cell line RPTEC/TERT1 was treated with sub-cytotoxic concentrations
    of cisplatin (0.5 and 2μM) in a daily repeat dose treating regime for up to 14days.
    Biokinetic analysis showed that cisplatin was taken up from the basolateral compartment,
    transported to the apical compartment, and accumulated in cells over time. This
    is in line with basolateral uptake of cisplatin via organic cation transporter
    2 and bioactivation via gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase located on the apical side
    of proximal tubular cells. Cisplatin affected several pathways including, p53
    signalling, Nrf2 mediated oxidative stress response, mitochondrial processes,
    mTOR and AMPK signalling. In addition, we identified novel pathways changed by
    cisplatin, including eIF2 signalling, actin nucleation via the ARP/WASP complex
    and regulation of cell polarization. In conclusion, using an integrated omic approach
    together with biokinetics we have identified both novel and established mechanisms
    of cisplatin toxicity.

  title: 'VARSCOT: variant-aware detection and scoring enables sensitive and personalized
    off-target detection for CRISPR-Cas9'
  status_changed: '2020-04-02 11:57:40'
  abstract: "BackgroundNatural variations in a genome can drastically alter
    the CRISPR-Cas9 off-target landscape by creating or removing sites. Despite the
    resulting potential side-effects from such unaccounted for sites, current off-target
    detection pipelines are not equipped to include variant information. To address
    this, we developed VARiant-aware detection and SCoring of Off-Targets (VARSCOT).ResultsVARSCOT
    identifies only 0.6% of off-targets to be common between 4 individual genomes
    and the reference, with an average of 82% of off-targets unique to an individual.
    VARSCOT is the most sensitive detection method for off-targets, finding 40 to
    70% more experimentally verified off-targets compared to other popular software
    tools and its machine learning model allows for CRISPR-Cas9 concentration aware
    off-target activity scoring.ConclusionsVARSCOT allows researchers
    to take genomic variation into account when designing individual or population-wide
    targeting strategies. VARSCOT is available from https://github.com/BauerLab/VARSCOT."

  title: Optimal precursor ion selection for LC-MALDI MS/MS
  abstract: "BackgroundLiquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) maps in
    shotgun proteomics are often too complex to select every detected peptide signal
    for fragmentation by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). Standard methods for precursor
    ion selection, commonly based on data dependent acquisition, select highly abundant
    peptide signals in each spectrum. However, these approaches produce redundant
    information and are biased towards high-abundance proteins.ResultsWe
    present two algorithms for inclusion list creation that formulate precursor ion
    selection as an optimization problem. Given an LC-MS map, the first approach maximizes
    the number of selected precursors given constraints such as a limited number of
    acquisitions per RT fraction. Second, we introduce a protein sequence-based inclusion
    list that can be used to monitor proteins of interest. Given only the protein
    sequences, we create an inclusion list that optimally covers the whole protein
    set. Additionally, we propose an iterative precursor ion selection that aims at
    reducing the redundancy obtained with data dependent LC-MS/MS. We overcome the
    risk of erroneous assignments by including methods for retention time and proteotypicity
    predictions. We show that our method identifies a set of proteins requiring fewer
    precursors than standard approaches. Thus, it is well suited for precursor ion
    selection in experiments with limited sample amount or analysis time.ConclusionsWe
    present three approaches to precursor ion selection with LC-MALDI MS/MS. Using
    a well-defined protein standard and a complex human cell lysate, we demonstrate
    that our methods outperform standard approaches. Our algorithms are implemented
    as part of OpenMS and are available under http://www.openms.de."

  abstract: Currently, the precursor ion selection strategies in LC-MS mainly choose
    the most prominent peptide signals for MS/MS analysis. Consequently, high abundant
    proteins are identified by MS/MS of many peptides whereas proteins of lower abundance
    might elude identification. We present a novel, iterative and result-driven approach
    for precursor ion selection that significantly increases the efficiency of an
    MS/MS analysis by decreasing data redundancy and analysis time. By simulating
    different strategies for precursor ion selection on an existing dataset we compare
    our method to existing result-driven strategies and evaluate its performance with
    regard to mass accuracy, database size, and sample complexity.

  title: 'High-performance liquid chromatography with electrospray ionization ion
    mobility spectrometry: Characterization, data management, and applications'
  abstract: The combination of high-performance liquid chromatography and electrospray
    ionization ion mobility spectrometry facilitates the two-dimensional separation
    of complex mixtures in the retention and drift time plane. The ion mobility spectrometer
    presented here was optimized for flow rates customarily used in high-performance
    liquid chromatography between 100 and 1500 μL/min. The characterization of the
    system with respect to such parameters as the peak capacity of each time dimension
    and of the 2D spectrum was carried out based on a separation of a pesticide mixture
    containing 24 substances. While the total ion current chromatogram is coarsely
    resolved, exhibiting coelutions for a number of compounds, all substances can
    be separately detected in the 2D plane due to the orthogonality of the separations
    in retention and drift dimensions. Another major advantage of the ion mobility
    detector is the identification of substances based on their characteristic mobilities.
    Electrospray ionization allows the detection of substances lacking a chromophore.
    As an example, the separation of a mixture of 18 amino acids is presented. A software
    built upon the free mass spectrometry package OpenMS was developed for processing
    the extensive 2D data. The different processing steps are implemented as separate
    modules which can be arranged in a graphic workflow facilitating automated processing
    of data.

  title: 'From the Desktop to the Grid: conversion of KNIME Workflows to gUSE'
  abstract: "The Konstanz Information Miner is a user-friendlygraphical workflow
    designer with a broad user base in industry and academia. Its broad range of embedded
    tools and its powerful data mining and visualization tools render it ideal for
    scientific workflows. It is thus used more and more in a broad range of applications.
    However, the free version typically runs on a desktop computer, restricting users
    if they want to tap into computing power. The grid and cloud User Support Environment
    is a free and open source project created for parallelized and distributed systems,
    but the creation of workflows with the included components has a steeper learning
    curve.In this work we suggest an easy to implement solutioncombining the
    ease-of-use of the Konstanz Information Minerwith the computational power
    of distributed computing infrastructures. We present a solution permitting the
    conversion of workflows between the two platforms. This enables a convenient development,
    debugging, and maintenance of scientific workflows on the desktop. These workflows
    can then be deployed on a cloud or grid, thus permitting large-scale computation.To
    achieve our goals, we relied on a Common Tool DescriptionXML file format which
    describes the execution of arbitraryprograms in a structured and easily readable
    and parseable way. In order to integrate external programs into we employed the
    Generic KNIME Nodes extension."

  title: 'From the desktop to the grid: scalable bioinformatics via workflow conversion'
  status_changed: '2017-11-22 13:42:20'
  abstract: "BackgroundReproducibility is one of the tenets of the scientific
    method. Scientific experiments often comprise complex data flows, selection of
    adequate parameters, and analysis and visualization of intermediate and end results.
    Breaking down the complexity of such experiments into the joint collaboration
    of small, repeatable, well defined tasks, each with well defined inputs, parameters,
    and outputs, offers the immediate benefit of identifying bottlenecks, pinpoint
    sections which could benefit from parallelization, among others. Workflows rest
    upon the notion of splitting complex work into the joint effort of several manageable
    tasks.There are several engines that give users the ability to design
    and execute workflows. Each engine was created to address certain problems of
    a specific community, therefore each one has its advantages and shortcomings.
    Furthermore, not all features of all workflow engines are royalty-free —an aspect
    that could potentially drive away members of the scientific community.ResultsWe
    have developed a set of tools that enables the scientific community to benefit
    from workflow interoperability. We developed a platform-free structured representation
    of parameters, inputs, outputs of command-line tools in so-called Common Tool
    Descriptor documents. We have also overcome the shortcomings and combined the
    features of two royalty-free workflow engines with a substantial user community:
    the Konstanz Information Miner, an engine which we see as a formidable workflow
    editor, and the Grid and User Support Environment, a web-based framework able
    to interact with several high-performance computing resources. We have thus created
    a free and highly accessible way to design workflows on a desktop computer and
    execute them on high-performance computing resources.ConclusionsOur
    work will not only reduce time spent on designing scientific workflows, but also
    make executing workflows on remote high-performance computing resources more accessible
    to technically inexperienced users. We strongly believe that our efforts not only
    decrease the turnaround time to obtain scientific results but also have a positive
    impact on reproducibility, thus elevating the quality of obtained scientific results."
