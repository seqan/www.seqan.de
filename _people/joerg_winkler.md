As a PhD candidate at Freie Universität Berlin and member of the graduate school IMPRS-BAC at the Max Planck Institute
for Molecular Genetics I work on algorithms for the analysis of long non-coding RNA.
I hold a Master of Science degree in Bioinformatics from University of Hamburg.

I have developed the two applications [LaRA](/apps/lara.html) for rapid structural RNA alignment and 
[MaRs](/apps/mars.html) for RNA motif search.
Furthermore, I contribute to the C++ SeqAn library with focus on multiple sequence alignment and structure analysis,
and I participate in the design and implementation of SeqAn's
[application template](https://github.com/seqan/app-template).

Generally, I am interested in nature and sustainability.
When I am not at work, you can find me climbing, hiking or kayaking.
